A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese , leading to fears that today 's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents . Obesity : Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers , a large-scale study has found ( file photo ) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription . By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese . And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight . Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler . Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics . They were also slightly taller than boys who had n't been given the drugs . The study did n't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain . But if they do , it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten . This frees up more food for the body . Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite . Lead author Dr Antti Saari , of Kuopio University Hospital , warned : 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age , or repeatedly during infancy , was associated with increased body mass in healthy children . 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy . The worldwide obesity epidemic is real , and is more pronounced for boys .

'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences . ' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems . The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat .

Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother \u2019 s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them \u2013 one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . \u2018 That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , \u2019 he told the Sunday People . \u2018 I was staggered . The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me , holding me in the chair . Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence \u2018 They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. \u2019 Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u2013 so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was \u2018 haunted \u2019 by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u2018 exhaustively and co-operatively \u2019 with any police probe . A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment \u2018 as investigations continue \u2019 .", "tgt": {"M11": "Christopher lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at clarence house .

From Friday to Monday , a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued , according to the Italian coast guard , which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress . On Tuesday , a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing , citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast . The Italian coast guard , however , told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously , it can not confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued . An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors , nor bodies , nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized , Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said . There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats . Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration , Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015 , and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily . Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria , the IOM said . They use Libya as a country of transit . At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year , often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers , the IOM said .

Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her .

Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury , pictured , to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil 's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off . After the suspected breach of exam rules , school officials were tipped off , resulting in an investigation being launched in June . The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same . It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told . Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct . The Department for Education annulled the whole school 's SAT 's results after a probe by the local education authority ( file picture ) However , he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers , but to make them more legible . But the panel , run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions . Panel chair Martin Pilkington said , although the teacher \u2019 s conduct had been dishonest , it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty . But he added : 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school , that can in no way excuse his behaviour . 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority . ' Paul Heathcote , acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan , banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years . He said : 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014 . 'Mr Guffick \u2019 s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress . 'In all the circumstances , I agree with the panel \u2019 s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction . 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions . ' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court .", "tgt": {"M11": "Ian guffick asked pupils to make changes to the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds .

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018 reckless \u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion , as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27 . Hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . Although it was accepted that there had been no intent , the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing . Yet , in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held . Nathan Hughes 's knee collided with George North 's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin 's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side 's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months . He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing , to counter-act his concussion symptoms . Graphic , slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin \u2019 s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes , but many more spoke up in his defence . Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club . Captain James Haskell said : \u2018 Astounded would be an under-statement \u2019 , while fly-half Andy Goode added : \u2018 Really can \u2019 t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes . There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome. \u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018 total joke \u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment , calling it an \u2018 absolute joke \u2019 . Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club \u2019 s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday , as he awaited his appeal hearing . He is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps \u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26 . Jeremy Summers , chairman of the appeal hearing panel , said : \u2018 The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh . Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel , it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally . \u2019", "tgt": {"M11": "Nathan hughes suffered his knee colliding with the head of the welsh lion .

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport . The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia . `` The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from , '' Durken said . The fires were started in southeastern Siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields . But on April 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV . As a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region . Rescue crews were able to put out the flames . However , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds . The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest . Parts of Oregon , Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination . The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , KOMO-TV said . That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered . The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye . As the smoke starts to dissipate , air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue .", "tgt": {"M11": "Deep reddish color caught seattle native tim durkan 's eye on april 14 .

It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors .

The result leaves United , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand . Injury-ravaged City however , have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series .

A look at all of the charges The sentencing phase begins Tuesday , a day after this year 's edition of the landmark race . It is expected to last four weeks . The 13th Juror : Now it gets real In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe , Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son , Martin . Their daughter , Jane , also was severely injured . `` Our family has grieved , buried our young son , battled injuries , and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same , '' they said in the Globe column titled `` To end the anguish , drop the death penalty . '' `` We sat in the courtroom , day after day , bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs , replicated bombs , and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive . '' They said they understood the `` heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed . '' `` We were there . We lived it . The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son , maimed our 7-year-old daughter , and stole part of our soul . '' But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close . `` We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal , '' they wrote . They go on to say : `` We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty , but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives . We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering , painful reminder of what the defendant took from them , which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring . '' Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15 , 2013 . Tsarnaev was convicted last week , while his brother , Tamerlan , was killed in a shootout with police two years ago . The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name .

Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half . 'It 's important to win a match and gain some continuity , ' De Sanctis said . 'The last ( four ) months were tough in terms of results . So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride . ' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack Pjanic ( second left ) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe , and Daniele de Rossi after scoring Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio , who play later on Saturday . They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30 . Meanwhile , Napoli 's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches , and Diego Maradona 's former club remained fifth . Security was tight for Napoli 's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season 's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico . Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis ( right ) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order . But there were no reports of problems . Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post . A few minutes later , Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi , who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in . Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma , who have fallen off the pace recently Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there was n't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli , who officiated last year 's World Cup final . In the second half , De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions . The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th . Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net . Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November .", "tgt": {"M11": "Roma beat napoli beat napoli in serie a on saturday .

But that doesn \u2019 t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid a stroke . Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera , Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage . The fish begins relaxing in the man 's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man \u2019 s fingers . The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation . Repeating the process , the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man \u2019 s hand to be stroked again . Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers . The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more . The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish , clearly saddened by this , following it up to the surface of the water . According to Mr Giroux , who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel , the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish . The fish swims away from the man 's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet . He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable . After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn \u2019 t play with it on a daily basis . The fish begins swimming around the man 's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day .

He has something about him , as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson \u2019 s face during the Ashes series . He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return . But I do believe he will need careful man-managing . Peter Moores , England \u2019 s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right . The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on . England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on . It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad . What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed . He can be feisty and fiery as long as it \u2019 s natural but his aggression has to be controlled . You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets .

There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible .

Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives . An international coalition responded , first by airdropping supplies in the mountains . Rescues came next . And then , starting in August , the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria . The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq , accounting for less than 1 % of the country 's population . CNN 's Raja Razek reported from Beirut .

{"i": "dm-test-d680ebcdcd59fd5ee9b602a06bcd5230c212835b", "src": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes . Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility .

The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week , which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk ' . The system , suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo , would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles ( 100km ) away . Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth \u2019 s atmosphere , where it would burn up . But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon : the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size .

Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls . ' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties . He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions . Keely Harvey , in mitigation , said : 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child 's hand . ' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant ' and he was made the subject of a hospital order . Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said : 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be . 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties , so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency .
