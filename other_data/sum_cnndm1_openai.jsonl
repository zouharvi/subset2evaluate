I cannot imagine how painful and lonely it must be to be homeless.'They deserve our attention and care, this issue cannot be ignored.'A spokeswoman for McDonald's said: 'The studs in question are not an 'anti- homeless' measure, as has been suggested.'They have been in place for around two years and were introduced Following discussions with the police, in response to issues we were experiencing with antisocial behaviour.'We welcome all customers through our doors and it is inaccurate to suggest a measure taken in response to tackling antisocial behaviour, is an attempt to deter homeless people.'", "ref": "78,000 sign petition to demand removal of spikes in Leeds city centre..

Dubbed 'one of the rarest types of Titanic collectable', the chair is too fragile to sit on, but has been carefully preserved, having been owned by a British collector for the past 15 years.A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected sold for \u00a3100,000 at auctionThe ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia.One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett. The anonymous seller kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast, never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item. It was sold yesterday at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Devizes, Wiltshire, to a UK buyer. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'.  He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today.Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova ScotiaTitanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the TitanicHe said that he was 'very, very pleased' with the price.The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall.It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic. Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001.Sold with the chair was an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic.Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years agoIt includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s.In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired.'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.'Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia.He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story.'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.'Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14.A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York.White Star Line chartered four ships, including the Halifax-based cable-laying vessel the Mackay-Bennett, to recover the bodies.", "ref": "Chair was on first class deck when ship hit an iceberg in April 1912 ..

They use Libya as a country of transit.At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year, often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers, the IOM said.Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships, leaving passengers to fend for themselves.Last week: 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean SeaCNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.", "ref": "The Italian Coast Guard says 8,480 migrants were rescued from Friday to Monday..

As of Monday, they were still seen in a neighbor's yard Alyssa says she went outside to check on her sibling, who is deaf, when she heard his screams and spotted a trio of large rottweilers biting the child in the brush by a dirt road.Setting aside concerns for her own safety, Alyssa ran over and scared off the hounds so she could tend to Elijah.The wounded boy could stand up or walk on his own, so his little sister picked him up and carried him home.'I was terrified, but I saved his life,' Alyssa told News Channel 4.When Elijah was brought to a nearby hospital for treatment, he immediately went into surgery.The injured child, who turned 11 Tuesday, was later released home with 40 staples on his head. He is now learning to walk again.Justice: Rhianna Bravenec (right), Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanizedStrong: The 9-year-old girl picked up her big brother and carried him home because he was unable to walk on his own after the attack In recovery: Elijah, who celebrated his 11th birthday Tuesday, is now learning how to walk again On Monday, the animals that attacked Elijah were still seen roaming around the neighbor's yard.Dog owner Martin Tidwell said that what happened to the 9-year-old was terrible.Rhianna Bravenec, Alyssa and Elijah's mother, said she wants all three dogs euthanized. The woman has another young daughter and a fourth child on the way.Tidwell said he has to wait until the end of a mandatory 10-day quarantine to put his pets down.Under state law, Tidwell is not required to euthanize his animals, but the man said he feels morally obligated to do so.Elijah's family have set up a GoFundMe account hoping to raise $5,000 to help with his mounting medical bills.", "ref": "Elijah mckenna, 11, was mauled by neighbor's three rottweilers in Oklahoma Saturday..

Now an app dubbed 'Project Elysium' claims to do just that by creating a 'personalised afterlife experience' with loved ones who have passed. The app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will workCreated by Australia-based Paranormal Games, the app's developers have yet to reveal exactly how the technology will work.What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model.An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick.'Dr Albert Rizzo, director of medical virtual reality at the University of Southern California said he believes potential users would have to send pictures and video of the deceased to the developer.What little we do know comes from their Twitter account, which features a screenshot showing someone being transformed into a 3D model. An accompanying caption says: 'Modelling my bestie and business partner Nick into Project Elysium. Our first demo will be personal to Nick'But the company may also need to harvest even more data so that they can construct the person's personality, mannerisms and movements.'If I knew I had an incurable disease, maybe I would do a full body scan and have a digital replica created,' Dr Rizzo told DailyMail.com.'And I would sit down for 20 hours and have people ask me questions about my life and what I think about different things.'He says this can all be programmed into virtual reality to create a living record of someone that people can interact with using VR headsets such as Oculus Rift.But experts are divided over how this can impact a user's mental health.Some argue that it can provide real comfort and support in times of grief, while others say it may prevent people from moving on from trauma.Bina48 is a robotic head that uses a 'Mind Clone' of the memories, belief and feelings of a real personIt may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years, according to a leading pioneer of the technology.The technology, which is similar to that seen in the film Transcendence starring Johnny Depp, is being developed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt.She has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic 'clone' of her wife Bina that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology.The robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of Bina by creating a database of her memories, beliefs and thoughts, along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares.This allows the robot, called Bina48, to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real, living person.Mrs Rothblatt, 60, an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman, believes the these 'Mind Clones' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died.'I think helping people to confront difficult emotional challenges done in a safe environment is a positive thing,' said Dr Rizzo.'When people avoid processing things, this is when it comes back and haunts them.''I don't think there is any disrespect to the dead to want to view them and interact with them,' he added.Project Elysium has been entered into the upcoming Oculus VR Jam 2015 contest.To be eligible for the jam's grand prize, the team have to showcase more screenshots by April 27, followed by video footage the week after.The grand prize winner in this track will receive $100,000, with runner ups earning $50,000, $30,000 and $10,000 respectively.'You can experience anything that's possible and anything that's impossible,' Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey told GamesBeat.'It puts you into a difference space where there's almost no rules.'Project Elysium has been entered into the upcoming Oculus VR Jam 2015.

Hayley James, who is four months pregnant and from Poole, said: 'To have a race of that scale with only one marshal on a point is inexcusable.'We saw loads of people walking at the end, some were in tears, I felt so sorry for them - I felt like crying at the 10km mark.'Andy Isaac, from Bournemouth, said the event was 'mayhem' with one point where an elderly woman managed to drive onto the route and was flashing her lights at oncoming runners. A map shows where up to 300 runners continued along the coastal path after a marshal who was meant to direct them on to a turn went to the toiletReaction: Two people vent their frustration at the Bournemouth Bay Run on Twitter yesterdayIt also emerged that water stations ran out of supplies during the race, forcing some runners to drink from half-empty bottles that had been left on the ground as they battled against dehydration.Commenting on the Daily Echo website, one runner said: \"We had a bottle of water at the three mile station, but at the six mile point they had totally ran out, so nothing.Jon Weaver, head of resort marketing and events at the council, said: 'Unfortunately there was some confusion with marshalling arrangements at one point, but it was a critical point. We apologise unreservedly to those front runners.'In 33 years of running... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully... to learn for 2016.'We understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling.'It was hoped that the event would have raised more than \u00a370,000 for the British Heart Foundation. Some racers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the blunder. Rob Kelly wrote: Really disappointed in the #BournemouthBayRun 10k that ended up 13k very poor show bad marshalling #wontbeback.'AndKim Kelly replied: 'Totally agree and never got to do a 5k as they were 45mins behind schedule :(((.'", "ref": "Up to 300 runners in yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run sent wrong way ..

In 2013 he slept in his car at the Tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetingsThe mayor, who was chairing the meeting of Camden Council in north London, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber.But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change.The rumpus comes a month after Liberal Democrat councillor Martin Elengorn was caught playing Scrabble during a Richmond Council budget meeting in south-west London.Telling off: Mayor of Camden Council, Lazzaro Pietragnoli, had to tell Mr Bucknell to stop eatingWhen he first noticed him eating, Mr Blackwell told his fellow councillors: 'It appears that one of our Tory colleagues is consuming a full Sunday roast dinner in the council chamber.'Could I ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky Snickers.'The diner was forced to curtail his meal.Mr Bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents Belsize, Hampstead, told the Evening Standard: 'I never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber.'They should definitely repeal it. There is nothing wrong with nibbling from a lunch box if you are being discreet.'It is not as if a cold meal is going to waft around like a McDonald's.'I will be campaigning for the repealing of the law that says you can't nibble from a lunch box in the council chamber.'The Conservative councillor said the meal, in a plastic box, had travelled home with him after a French snowboarding holiday.'The chalet always brought out too much food and I can't stand wasting food,' he said.He previously found fame when he slept in his Volvo car to save on hotel bills during the Conservative party conference in September 2013.Mr Bucknell said at the time it was to make a stand against what he called 'ridiculous prices'. He said the economy would improve if more people were thrifty like him. After the council meeting mayor Lazzaro Pietragnoli said: 'I understand councillors do a difficult job and sometimes don't get time to eat dinner.'I also tend to be quite flexible, but having a big meal in front of him - that was a bit too much.'A Camden Council spokesman said: 'It is as the mayor said, standing orders say that members should not eat in the chamber.'No eating: The Camden Council chamber where Councillor Bucknell was forced to curtail his roast dinner", "ref": "Labour rival alerted colleagues after spotting Councillor tucking into roast .. It is not the first time jonny Bucknell, 58, has demonstrated odd behaviour.. In 2013 he slept in his car to make a point while attending Tory conference..

The discovery comes as scientists in the US made a breakthrough that could lead a test to flag up the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer.A protein has been identified which seems to play a crucial role in the rapid growth of tumours.The breath test discovery is hoped to save thousands of lives. About 7,000 people develop stomach cancer in the UK each year and most of these cases are in the advanced stages when they are diagnosed.Research leader Professor Hossam Haick of the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute in Haifa, said: 'The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, insensitivity to confounding factors, and potentially low cost.'Breathe: The tscreening system spots chemical signals in exhaled air that are linked to tumour development (stock image)Previous research has found that other methods could be used to identify stomach cancer, but none looked at detecting pre-cancerous changes.In the study published online in the journal Gut, breath samples were taken from 484 people, including 99 already diagnosed with stomach cancer.They were analysed by so-called nanomaterial sensors, which are able to read a chemical signal or pattern linked with stomach cancer based on very small particles in a patient's breath.The test is so accurate it could detect the difference between early and late stage gastric cancers. The researchers hope the breath test could be used as an alternative to endoscopies, an invasive and expensive procedure to diagnose gastric cancers using a long flexible tube. A large trial involving thousands of patients, including those with stomach cancer or pre-cancerous changes, is currently under way in Europe to test the technology's suitability as a screening method, they add.Meanwhile, US experts say the discovery of a new biomarker protein may one day lead to a test which differentiates men with aggressive prostate cancer from those with a less threatening form of the disease. The findings, published in the scientific journal Oncogene, raises hope of tests that deliver an accurate diagnosis from the outset.The results could lead to more targeted treatment for those with the worst cancers \u2013 and less treatment for men whose tumours are not dangerous. Professor Renny Franceschi, of the University of Michigan, said it paves the way for a 'warning light' that signals how dangerous the cancer is. It might also one day lead to a treatment which stops tumours growing.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, with 40,000 diagnosed in Britain every year. Current tests only identify whether a tumour is likely to be present.But they are unreliable, holding a high risk of 'false positives' that wrongly identify healthy men as having cancer.Professor Franceschi said that if further research proves positive, eventually it might lead to a test involving a simple biopsy when the patient first complains of symptoms.", "ref": "Tests spot chemical signals in exhaled air linked to tumour development ..

We didn't deserve any more but this wasn't a case of us blowing hot and cold. We've no divine right to come here and win.'I said before the game this would be a tough place to come. OK, we didn't play as fluently as we would have liked but Livvy were fighting for their lives. They are a physical side and Hibs and Queen of the South have still to come here.Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotionMyles Hippolyte gave Livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset Rangers'It was a game that panned out the way I expected on a tight park, dry and bumpy. It was a fair result. You can't stop a free kick like that (by Hippolyte).'Meanwhile, Mark Burchill was left ruing a first half 'goal' by Hippolyte that was chalked off after a supposed foul by Jordan White on Cammy Bell. But the Livvy boss was also left lamenting his team's dire defending 120 seconds after taking the lead through Hippolyte's fine freekick.'I think everyone here knows it should have been a goal by Myles in the first half,' he sighed.Marius Zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for Rangers at the Energy Assets Arena'I'm just really disappointed. It was a terrible goal for us to lose. If you go ahead in a match you really want to do better than that. When you've taken the lead that's your most vulnerable time as a team. And I just feel if we had weathered that then Rangers would have run out of ideas.'It was not the best we have played but I felt we more than matched Rangers tonight. I watched them on Sunday against Raith and I thought we could get three points from them and I'm disappointed we never managed to do that.'", "ref": "Rangers held to a 1-1 draw by bottom side Livingston on Wednesday..

Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime.Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool.An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly \u00a3100,000 in cash were also found.He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences.He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013.A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested.'He got other people to bring him food and other things in the villa where he hid out, leading the life of an authentic fugitive.'

He believes he was saved by Jesus Christ watching over himParamedics saw the scene and feared the worst. Ambulance staff and firefighters were working to release him and were shocked to see the driver emerge from the wreckage and walk away unaidedYet as paramedics and firefighters worked to release him, they were shocked to see him emerge from the wreckage and walk away unaided.Since then, paramedics have said the crash would certainly have been fatal if the impact had been just a couple of inches closer to the driver.  Now the dad-of-one has said he believes someone was watching over him that day.'It was not luck. It was definitely Jesus Christ, son of God, that saved me,' he said.Marcin suffered a serious injury to the left side of his face, which has left him with a deep scar, and injured his left arm.He's currently unable to work because of his injuries but he is volunteering for the Christ Celebration Centre in Lockhurst Lane, Foleshill, while he recovers.He also spoke of what he remembers about the night that nearly claimed his life.Father of one Mr Wasniewski said: 'Before the accident I remember everything. I can remember driving along.'I don't remember the accident though - when the crash happened everything just went blank.'The next thing I remembered was waking up in hospital. I left hospital after five days.'Road to recovery: There's barely a scratch on Marcin Wasniewski who walked away from the dramatic crash scenes, picture below, after driving into the back of a lorry on the A444 in CoventryTwisted metal: Paramedics say that the outcome would've 'certainly been fatal' if the impact had been just a couple of inches closer to the driver's side or if a passenger had been in the carAfter the crash on March 8, it was reported how ambulance staff were stunned that Marcin had escaped life-threatening injuries.A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman had described how thetrailer had 'literally embedded' itself into the windscreen of the car.She added that while paramedics and firefighters worked to release him, the driver 'got out of the badly damaged car unaided'.She said: 'Whilst being assessed in the back of the ambulance, paramedics discovered that he had escaped the serious injuries often expected in such a significant collision.'The paramedic area support officer commented that, if the impact had have been a couple of inches further across into the driver's side or if there had been a passenger in the car, the outcome would've certainly been fatal.'", "ref": "Trailer 'embedded' into car windscreen in smash on A444 in Coventry..

But last week it was on the issue of quotas, or more specifically FA chairman Greg Dyke's idea of increasing the number of homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12.'I believe that we are in the world of competition,' said Wenger in one of his regular interviews to beIN Sports. 'That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best or we are not in a competition anymore.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shows his frustrations during a Premier League match in March 2011FA chairman Greg Dyke pictured attending the friendly between England and Italy in Turin on Tuesday'So we can say one or two things \u2013 we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players. If you want to sell the Premier League for a huge amount of money then we need to say: \"Buy this, this is the best league in the world.\" You cannot go against the quality and what is at the heart of our job, which is competition.'And on the surface there seems nothing wrong with this. As an economics graduate Wenger is a disciple of Adam Smith and these are the basic principles of a free market. Tear down barriers, let competition flourish and the best man or woman will ultimately win \u2013 or at least have a place in Wenger's starting XI.It sounds sensible enough but of course the issue is a little more complex than Wenger implies. A cursory glance at Wenger's transfer record shows in his bid to save the Premier League from English mediocrity he has signed Tomas Danilevicius, Igor Stepanovs, Kaba Diawara, Sebastian Squillaci, Andre Santos, Amoury Bischoff, Park Chu-Young, Marouane Chamakh, Pascal Cygan, Philippe Senderos, Denilson, Manuel Almunia and Johan Djourou.Arsenal's Andre Santos on the ball during a league match against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in 2011Marouane Chamakh (left) attempts to control the ball during a Capital One Cup clash with Reading in 2012Arsenal midfielder Denilson (left) holds off Leyton Orient's Stephen Dawson at the Emirates in 2011There are more but that's what a brief search elicits. You might argue that you need to sign ten Park Chu-youngs to get one Robin van Persie. And of course, over 18 years any manager, even a great one as Wenger is, can make some dud buys. He made some very good ones from abroad as well: Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Cesc Fabegas... we could go on.But the list of shame does expose a flaw at the heart of his argument. Clubs always argue for fewer restrictions and they always say it is to do with excellence. The reality is it's just as much to do with cost. There is nothing in Greg Dyke's proposals to stop Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla playing for Arsenal. It might however make it a little trickier for the likes of Almunia, Andre Santos and Stepanovs in the future.The reason why Arsenal went for Stepanovs back in 2000 was not because it he was excellent; it was because he was cheaper than the equivalent English player; same with Almunia in 2004 and Andre Santos in 2011. Turns out they weren't good enough either.Arsenal's Park Chu-young in action during a Carling Cup match against Shrewsbury Town in 2011Igor Stepanovs (left) battles with Sunderland's Kevin Phillips for the ball at Highbury in December 2000Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia watches a shot go wide at the Emirates Stadium in January 2011Now it may be that applying more quotas could be detrimental to Dyke's vision of encouraging clubs to play English players in that it pushes their price up even more. That's a debate worth having but the main thrust of Dyke's proposals is simply to encourage the clubs to rely less on the marketplace and grow their own players.For Wenger's argument sounds great in theory but the reality is that there is a class of players at the tip of the footballers' pyramid which stand out and which any team would want \u2013 the Thierry Henrys, Patrick Vierias of this world. Nothing in Dyke's rules to prevent them from signing, as they were EU nationals. You would only have to be a little more sure you could find space for them as one of your 13 \u2013 that's 13! \u2013 foreign players in your squad of 25.But there is another tier of players below that \u2013 let's says the Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta level (who would also still be available under they Dyke proposals as EU players). These are good players, but they are much more plentiful than the elite. In fact, given the right training and a chance in the first team, you could probably produce your own. Arsenal did once: Ray Parlour. Served Wenger quite well, too, in his double-winning and Invincible years.Ray Parlour falls to the ground after a tackle by Tottenham's Jamie Redknapp at White Hart Lane in 2004Wenger (left) watches on from the touchline as Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last monthBut Parlour was developed before Wenger arrived and he was the beneficiary of a youth system which was thriving at the time. The Arsenal manager, since his arrival, has never shown an awful amount of interest in Arsenal's youth set-up. He is undoubtedly a manager who supports young players \u2013 it's just most of them are signed from abroad or Southampton rather than coming from his own academy.The fact that Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere are regular starters and were players developed at Arsenal's academy during Wenger's 18 years is exceptional for his period as manager. Ashley Cole was his greatest find from that source but who knows what would have happened to him had Silvinho not had to leave the club suddenly when his Portuguese nationality was called into question?All Dyke is trying to do is focus clubs and their managers on trying a little bit harder to look in their own backyard before spending \u00a32million on Pascal Cygan. Nothing he has proposed would stop Premier League clubs from signing genuine superstars. The 'best league in the world' (the league, incidentally, without any qualifiers in the Champions League quarter-finals under the current policy) is under no threat whatsoever.Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs (left) breaks past QPR's Darnell Furlong at Loftus Road last monthArsenal's Jack Wilshere (front) charges forward with the ball during a friendly against Brentford on TuesdaySadly Dyke probably killed his idea by announcing it in public before asking the clubs. If there is one thing guaranteed to rile the Premier League, it's attempting to dictate terms. The only way to cajole the multi-national group of owners and executives into helping English football is by convincing them it's in their own interests.Most are already on board in theory with the narrative that homegrown players are worthwhile. But now they need an additional nudge to take the final step and actually play some of their expensively-trained academy players. Even Mauricio Pochettino, who has a great track record with English players, wouldn't have given Harry Kane a go if Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor had been producing.But if Kane isn't a good enough incentive for the Premier League clubs to work harder to promote players, perhaps their recent travails in the Champions League and Europa League might convince them. A majority of the best players in the world are being produced in Spain and South America; another significant proportion come from Germany.Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor gestures during the Capital One Cup semi-final in JanuaryTottenham star Harry Kane celebrates after scoring against Leicester at White Hart Lane last monthThe best of those players will naturally aspire to play for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Now that Financial Fair Play restrictions mean the wages are no bigger over here, those that come to the Premier League will be the second tier of stars that can't make it at those clubs. If English clubs want to be the best in the world, they're going to have to become an awful lot better at creating the best players.And if Wenger wants to examine something truly mediocre he might wish to cast his eye over the Premier League's record in Europe over the past three seasons. In fact, if he paid a little more attention to building a core of homegrown players then perhaps, like Ajax, AC Milan, Manchester United, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Arsenal might have won the Champions League by now.", "ref": "Fa chairman Greg Dyke wants to increase the minimum homegrown players in a Premier League squad of 25 from eight to 12..

Be ready for a quake.'The whales first began to appear on the beach last week but officials said they had discovered eight more bodies today.Local residents had rushed to the beaches with buckets and towels in an attempt to help keep the marine mammals alive. Scientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of Hokota cityLocal resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon-headed whales alive on the beachesOfficials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon-headed whales after they strandedHowever, almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean.The strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of Japan is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity.Around 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in New Zealand just two days before a large earthquake hit Christchurch in 2011.The 2004 Boxing Day earthquake in the Indian Ocean that also triggered a devastating tsunami also saw 170 whales stranded on beaches in Australia and New Zealand in the days before.Those whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the Japan Coast Guard to return them to the oceanJapan Coast Guard personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the seaThe whales were stranded on two beaches close to Hokota city around 60 miles north of TokyoAccording to the US Geological Survey, which monitors tremors around the world, there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles (252km) off the coast of Namie, Japan.Quakes of this size are relatively common along the fault line.However, researchers have found it is possible detect tiny pulses in the Earth's magnetic field in the areas around the epicentre of earthquakes in the weeks before they occur.Researchers at San Jose State University have been developing new techniques to use these pulses to predict earthquakes using highly sensitive magnetometres.However, it is not know if whales have the ability to detect such tiny fluctuations.Tadasu Yamada, a senior researcher at the National Museum of Nature and Science, said investigations were still ongoing into what caused the whales to strand in Hokato.He told public broadcaster NHK: 'We don't see any immediate signs of diseases on their bodies, such as cancer.'We want to figure out what killed these animals.'Residents struggled to return the whales to the sea after the mammals became exhausted in the shallow waterOnce stranded, the animals are vulnerable to dehydration and sunburn until rescuers can use the high tide to move their massive weight back into deeper water.Efforts to save the dolphins stood in marked contrast to the global view of Japan and its relationship with cetaceans.Despite international opprobrium, Japan hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast, and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the Antarctic Ocean, where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling.It has never made a secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed.A United Nations court ruled last year that the Antarctic hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as research, prompting Tokyo to suspend operations, but it vowed to redesign the programme to make it more scientific.The International Whaling Commission's (IWC) panel of experts said today that it opposed Japan's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme, saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales.", "ref": "The whales washed up along a 6 mile stretch of Coast near Hokato, Japan ..

Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead.\"Oh! I shot him. I'm sorry,\" Bates said in a video of the shooting.But it's happened before. In a well-publicized 2009 case, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser, killing 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland, California.The former officer, Johannes Mehserle, testified that he had meant to use his Taser but drew his gun instead. Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct.So how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a Taser? Here are some factors to consider:Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body, and the Taser should be placed on the nondominant side. So if an officer is left-handed, the gun should be on the left side.Bates' attorney said his client is left-handed. But the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side.\"I shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed,\" Bates said in a written statement to investigators.After Bates announced at the scene he was going to use his Taser, he \"used his nondominant hand, and it was the gun,\" said Clark Brewster, Bates' attorney.\"He said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder, assumed it was the Taser,\" Brewster said. \"Both the gun and the Taser have a laser sight, and he just made a mistake.\"Brewster also said his client's left hand was holding a pepper gun.In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had grabbed a \"pepper ball launcher\" to try to slow or stop Harris, who was running away.Bates did not say explicitly where the Taser was on his body. But he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was \"startled\" by the recoil of the gun.\"After realizing what had happened I was in a state of shock and disbelief,\" he told investigators.Bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison.Deputy who shot Eric Harris turns himself inBates was carrying his personal gun, a Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolver, and a Model X26 Taser, he said in his statement to investigators.Attorneys representing the Harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices.One held up a small black .357 revolver, followed by a mostly bright yellow Taser that was noticeably larger than the gun.\"There's no way an officer can get this confused with this,\" said one of the attorneys from the law firm of Smolen, Smolen & Roytman.Taser's X26 model comes in different designs. Some are mostly yellow, while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle. But all appear to be larger than Smith & Wesson .357 five-shot revolvers.Sgt. Jim Clark of the Tulsa Police Department -- which is separate from the county sheriff's office for which Bates volunteered -- said Bates was the \"victim\" of something called \"slip and capture.\" That's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation.But a criminal justice expert told CNN the claim amounts to \"junk science.\"\"There's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this. ... It's not generally accepted by the scientific community,\" said Phil Stinson, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University. \"So it's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence.\"An attorney for the Harris family said the \"slip and capture\" theory hasn't held up in court.\"The only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in Oakland (of Oscar Grant),\" the attorney said. And that defense failed.Tasers are built to feel and look different than guns, according to Taser International.Steve Tuttle, vice president for strategic communications at Taser, noted some of those differences to CNN: A gun is heavier. A Taser has a different grip and feel. When you take the safety off on a Taser, an LED control panel lights up.There's more: Tasers can be different colors (yellow or black), and the holster is different from a gun's.But in the field, where an officer reacts on instinct, there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important, Tuttle said.Taser's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer's nondominant side, as law enforcement experts say. And its training suggests that officers shout aloud, \"Taser! Taser! Taser!\" as they prepare to deploy it.These guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for.It is up to each law enforcement department, however, in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body.The company declined to comment on the Tulsa shooting in particular.The stun guns, or conducted electrical weapons, manufactured by Taser have been used more than 2.7 million times, Tuttle said, and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death.CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Brooke Baldwin, Ed Lavandera and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.", "ref": "Attorney: Robert Bates assumed the gun was a Taser because he saw a laser sight on it..

It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.'Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country in 2014, only 72,000 qualified.Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, too many tattoos or a lack of education - but 10 percent didn't qualify because they were overweight. According to the CDC, 81 percent of overweight boys and 71 percent of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight.Army recruiters, facing overweight prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up, have become fitness coaches - much like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser.Boot camp: The maximum body fat percentage that the army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for femalesThe recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp. Many still fail to make the grade, but some do - such as a female recruit from Kansas who lost 80 pounds in a year so that she could sign up.'We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,' said Batschelet. 'We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.'The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits aged 17-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for females.  The maximum a female soldier, aged 17-20, can weigh is 227 pounds, while the maximum for a male soldier in the same age group is 234 pounds and in both instances that is dependent on being 80 inches tall.Obesity rates have tripled in a generation with more than one-third of U.S. adults now considered obese, while 17 percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. Army recruiters are having to act like the trainers on NBC's The Biggest Loser (ex-trainer Jillian Michaels pictured above) when they met prospective soldiers who are eager to sign up but are too fat to fight", "ref": "General in charge of us Army Recruiting has warned that America's growing obesity epidemic 'is becoming a national security issue' major General Allen Batschelet says 10 percent of young men and women are currently refused because they are too heavy..

Trabzon Governor Abdil Celil Oz said the two suspects were detained early on Tuesday and that one of them is believed to have followed the convoy while the other fired shots with a rifle at the bus.The decision to suspend football in Turkey affects both next weekend's Super Lig fixtures and the midweek cup quarter-finals, although Besiktas' match against Istanbul Basaksehir, the last of this weekend's Super Lig matches, is scheduled to go ahead on Monday evening.Fenerbahce's bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor, which Fener won 5-1, in Turkey's Super Lig.Five round marks can be seen on the windscreen of the Fenerbahce team bus after the attackThe window nearest the driver was smashed during the attack on Saturday nightThe injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help  after the attackFenerbahce on Sunday demanded that football be suspended until the incident was dealt with and the perpetrators punished, and on Monday a one-week suspension was announced by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) following a meeting with sports minister Akif Cagatay Kilic.'This was a cowardly and treacherous attack,' Kilic said in comments on the TFF website.He added: 'I think it's important to make this response. This was an attack not just on Fenerbahce, but an attack on Turkish sport and Turkish football. I believe we will stand as one against it.'Kilic also wished a speedy recovery to the bus driver, named as Ufuk Kiran, who was injured in the attack.The club had posted several pictures of the bus on their website after the attack which showed a shattered side window and damage to the front windscreen.The pictures also showed blood on the driver's seat and the steering wheel.The attack followed Fener's 5-1 win away to Rizespor.The bus was going over a viaduct on its way from the city of Rize to the airport in Trabzon to return to Istanbul when the incident occurred.Fenerbahce had temporarily gone top of the league with Saturday's win, although Galatasaray returned to the summit on Sunday by beating Karabukspor 4-2, and they sit two points clear with eight matches remaining.

For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.'On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa.Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling outThe fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park.'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said.'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood.'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood.'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.'Pochettino will come up against his countryman Jonas Guiterrez following his recovery from cancerThis weekend's match against Newcastle will also see Pochettino come up against a countryman who has made many a headline of late.Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many.'I am very happy for him,' Pochettino said. 'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football.'This is real life. Sometimes we worry about a lot of things and results, but this is real life when you have the problems that he has.'For me, I am very happy to see him come back to football.'", "ref": "Tottenham travel to Newcastle for their premier league clash on Sunday..

He said: 'My coaches told me I had lost the fight like a baby. They said I embarrassed my country and I would be in big trouble when we are at home.'After three months sleeping rough, Mr Keita handed himself in to authorities and was locked up in an immigration detention centre.While there he made two requests for asylum, both of which were rejected. After the second failed request, he was told he had to leave Britain on December 17, 2013.He agreed to board a plane to Ghana, but upon arrival there he said that he was turned back because he did not have the correct travel documents. He returned to Britain and was once again detained. However, he was released in March 2014 and has since been coaching judo in Stoke-on-Trent. He now plans to make a third application for asylum.Mr Keita said he has built a new life in Britain and has met friends who have become like family.'The people here are really welcoming, if you show them you are a good person,' he added.Mr Keita was one of 20 Olympians who remained in Britain after the Games. He is refusing to leave the UK after he lost by ippon in the qualifying stages of the Men's +100kg against 34-stone Ricardo Blas Junior, from Guam (right)Keita claims his coaches told him he lost the fight 'like a baby' and there would be trouble when he returnedHe is now being supported by an asylum seeker charity in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, while he applies for his third asylum application, after his first two bids and an appeal were refusedHe is volunteering at a Sneyd Green Primary School Judo Club in Stoke (pictured) because he cannot earn a living pending his asylum applicationBefore travelling to the UK for the Olympics, he had won five national titles in Guinea and regularly appeared on TV.Mr Keita denies he has stayed in Britain to claim benefits.He said: 'My situation is difficult, 100 per cent difficult. I want to be near my family and I want to see them but I can't.'His request to stay in Britain has been backed by the African Social Health Agency, which supports asylum seekers. It described Mr Keita as an asset to the local community.A Home Office spokesman said: 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases.'The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we consider every claim on its individual merits.'When someone is found not to need our protection, we expect them to leave the country.'", "ref": "Facinet Keita, 31, represented Guinea in Men's +100kg Judo but lost bout..

Now click here to read the full qualifying report.  Host commentatorThank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday's race.1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson'Oh come on, guys', Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs.Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn't matter as Rosberg can't beat his lap. It is Hamilton's pole.Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they're all on fresh tyres. Here we go\u2026   Meanwhile...Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We've got four minutes to run.   The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres.  And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate.Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903\u2026 but it is Hamilton up next.    We'll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track.   So, we're already underway with the final session to determine the top 10\u2026 surely, Lewis Hamilton won't be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year?So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we're in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop.Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton's mighty lap.Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton\u2026 what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari?   Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion.  Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend.  Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning.The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That's quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow's race only 17th and 18th.So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go\u2026   Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn's turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas.   Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third.  Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the 'rears are overheating'.Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth\u2026 for now.So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen.Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third.Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch.Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate.Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes is fired up, but there's no problem with the world champion's Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap\u2026Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week's race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday's second practice session.The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: 'I want a car. I've got a ticket.'Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term.Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon's qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai.Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year.The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg.Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton's best lap.Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today's qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix.After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were.Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week's Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.", "ref": "Lewis Hamilton claimed his third straight pole position of the season ..

Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become.Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester UnitedBale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supportersBale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-finalHe said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.'Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season.Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side.Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on WednesdayThe Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutesThe possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid.In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid.He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time.Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del ReyThe former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last seasonHe wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps.At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest.In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate.Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker CasillasDe Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by ChelseaDe Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain.He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2.Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable.De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318millionAll that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real.The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season.Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.", "ref": "Gareth Bale has been linked with a summer move to Manchester United.. The Wales forward has been criticised by Real Madrid fans this season .. United want Bale but he has No desire to cut short his time in Spain.. A swap deal involving United keeper David De Gea has been mooted..

I think Mooresey had only just found out himself. You see it when football clubs get taken over; you tend to see different people brought in for key positions. Paul was a lovely guy and I feel sorry he's lost his job but when you get new people in, changes always happen.There have been a few names bandied around and I think Straussy [Andrew Strauss] was considered last time the role came up a year ago, but he didn't particularly fancy it. He's certainly a very good man, but it's hard to know who would be a good candidate until we know more about what the job role is. But Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart are all former England captains who would all bring their own experience and knowledge to the role.Stuart Broad admits he was sorry to see Paul Downton leave his role in the ECBDownton (centre) was sacked as ECB managing director after a dismal World Cup this yearALASTAIR COOKHe seems in a really happy place and excited to be back around the group. He'd be the last person to make too much of a fuss about a hundred in a warm-up game but I'd back him to score big runs in this series \u2014 he looks refreshed and ready to go.PLAYER POWERIt's incredibly important that all the players feel they can contribute and speak up when they need to. That can be quite a scary thing but you only get better as a group when you do that. I did an Adidas event with Harlequins winger Ugo Monye and he was saying how player-led they were at the club. During the World Cup we didn't talk enough as players and the guys weren't speaking up as much as they needed to. We needed more edge and hopefully bringing guys like Cooky and Trotty [Jonathan Trott] back into the group will help that.Broad has backed Alastair Cook to score big runs during the series in the CaribbeanCaptain Cook scored a century during a warm-up game against St Kitts & NevisRICHIE BENAUDI used to watch videos of my dad playing in the 1986-87 Ashes series and I'll always remember Richie's commentary on that. He had this way of sounding as if he was reciting commentary when he was commentating and making it relaxing and peaceful to listen to. I don't think there'll be anyone in the cricket world who won't be touched by his passing. His voice symbolised cricket and we'll all miss him.JIMMY ANDERSONHe's one of my best mates and we've played a lot of cricket together. He's taught me a huge amount and guided me through my international career. I think we're third behind Waqar [Younis] and Wasim [Akram] and Curtly [Ambrose] and Courtney [Walsh] as a pairing and that comes from us complementing each other's styles and constant communication. It would a phenomenal achievement for him to become England's leading wicket taker.Broad says that he and Jimmy Anderson are best mates and admits he has guided him through his careerBroad says it will be a great achievement for Jimmy Anderson to become England's leading wicket takerFITNESSTwisting my ankle in the warm-up game was a bit of a scare, but it feels fine now. There was a burning feeling for a minute or so after it happened and I was pretty worried. It's still bit stiff in the morning but fingers crossed it will be OK.ANTIGUA TRACKThey're generally pretty flat out here now and I think fans can expect some fairly attritional cricket for the first few days before things speed up a bit. We've been practising our slip catching low down by our ankles because we're not expecting a lot of carry. I think the team that wins the series will be the one that shows most patience and gets the best out of reverse swing.Broad twisted his ankle during the warm-up match but insists he feels fine now", "ref": "England start their three test series against west indies next Monday ..

'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones.

TV presenter and beauty editor Nadine Baggott wrote: 'RIP Frederic Brandt - I loved every fascinating minute spent interviewing him.' @idrisjoel postd on Twitter: #RIP to one of the kindest and most brilliant physician I've ever met, Dr Frederic Shelton Brandt.'TV Host Jeannette Kaplun \u200fwrote: 'So sad that the world has lost a wonderful, kind and brilliant human being, Dr. Frederic Brandt' Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feederMartin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tubeDr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short.The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured)Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.  Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt", "ref": "Cosmetic dermatologist To the stars Fredric Brandt died at his Coconut Grove home in Miami on Sunday, aged 65  ..

But a bid by the league board to force play-off finalists to charge all fans a minimum price of \u00a315 for the play-off ties was withdrawn at a meeting last Thursday.Motherwell will go to battle with the SPFL over free entry to the Premiership play-offs for season-ticket holdersMotherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish 11thExpressing unease among the play-off finalists that the SPFL might be using the ties to milk supporters, Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows told Sportsmail his club will make a stand if they finish in the Premiership play-off place.'All our focus at Motherwell in the next four games is fully on avoiding the play-offs altogether,' said Burrows.'We fully accept and appreciate that there are rules on this in place.'But, in the eventuality that we are in 11th place come the play-offs, then it is not our intention to charge our season-ticket holders for the play-off final at Fir Park.'We believe we have sold them tickets which entitle them to the full story of the season.'Rangers sources said last night that the club have yet to reach a final decision on whether to seek an SPFL exemption which would allow them to let their 25,000 season ticket holders into play-off games for free.The SPFL are entitled to take 50 per cent of the gate proceeds but Motherwell want to offer free ticketsHibs gained a one-off dispensation to give their most loyal fans free admission to last season's home play-off clash with Hamilton.Sportsmail understands, however, that SPFL lawyers have already warned clubs that attempts to do the same this season will be strongly resisted as it would constitute a breach of league rules.Last week, a resolution by Hibs and Motherwell to have the 50-per-cent levy on play-off gates cut in half was defeated.Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsorAccused of a cash grab to keep more of the play-off cash, Hibs argue their main concern is that fans are being fleeced to atone for the absence of a league sponsor for the last two seasons.Asked if he expects a fight on the matter from league chiefs, Burrows admitted: 'Based on what has gone previously, then yes.'", "ref": "Motherwell will offer free entry to their regular fans if they end up in play-off..

From inside the massive complex, airmen were poised to send warnings that could trigger the launch of nuclear missiles.But in 2006, officials decided to move the headquarters of NORAD and US Northern Command from Cheyenne to Petersen Air Force base in Colorado Springs. The Cheyenne bunker was designated as an alternative command center if needed.Almost 10 years ago, the military closed the secretive defense complex carved into Cheyenne Mountain that for decades monitored American skies for threats.The North American Aerospace Defense Command operations center was moved to nearby Peterson Air Force Base, which is home to the U.S. Northern Command created after the Sept. 11 attacks.Cheyenne Mountain Complex is 2,000 feet below the granite rocks and made up of 15 three-story buildings protected from nuclear blasts and seismic movement by a system of 1,000 giant springs.The entire complex is designed to withstand a direct hit by a 30 megaton nuclear explosion and has 25-ton blast doors surrounding the complex.NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian command, was set up in the 1960s to monitor the skies for threats like missiles, aircraft and space objects.In 2006, Adm. Tim Keating, who commanded both NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command, said the government's best intelligence 'led them to believe a missile attack from China or Russia was very unlikely.'Cold War heroes: The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attackThat, along with the emergence of varied terrorist threats such as suicide bombers, 'was why we recommended that we don't need to maintain Cheyenne Mountain in a 24/7 status. We can put it on `warm standby,' said Keating.About 1,100 people work in the mountain, long a symbol of the Cold War. Buildings inside it are mounted on springs to absorb the shock from a nuclear blast, while the entrance is guarded by a vault-like door several feet thick.The complex includes banks of batteries and its own water supply. Excavation on the site began in 1961.Canadian crews stationed at Cheyenne Mountain will also made the move to Peterson, Keating said.Hollywood: Sci-fi movie Stargate (1994) was set inside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex while 1983's War Games also imagine a nuclear standoff operated from inside the nuclear bunkerThat move was touted a more efficient use of resources but had followed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of modernization work at Cheyenne carried out after the attacks of September 11, 2001.Now the Pentagon is looking at shifting communications gear to the Cheyenne bunker, officials said.'A lot of the back office communications is being moved there,' said one defense official.Officials said the military's dependence on computer networks and digital communications makes it much more vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse, which can occur naturally or result from a high-altitude nuclear explosion.Under the 10-year contract, Raytheon is supposed to deliver 'sustainment' services to help the military perform 'accurate, timely and unambiguous warning and attack assessment of air, missile and space threats' at the Cheyenne and Petersen bases.Raytheon's contract also involves unspecified work at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.", "ref": "Cheyenne Mountain Complex being refurbished by pengaton..

It shows 'ribbons' of sand and patterned stripes known as linear dunes in the Erg Chech, a desolate sand sea in southwestern Algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known.  Linear dunes, like these captured by Nasa's Landsat 7 satellite, are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). This image shows 'ribbons' of sand and patterned stripes in an area known as the Erg Chech, a desolate sand sea in southwestern Algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not knownThe image was spotted by io9 and the colours were caused as rays of sunlight hit the sand and were reflected off. Linear dunes are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). Ridges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as, more commonly, as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand and gravel. Linear dunes are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). Ridges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as, more commonly, as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand, gravel. The dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and the formation of these patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand. But exactly how this wind movement forms the structures is disputed.   The dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and the formation of these patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand. But exactly how this wind movement forms the structures is disputed.  One theory, suggested by Steven Hanna in 1969 in his Formation of Longitudinal Sand Dunes by Large Helical Eddies in the Atmosphere paper, is that linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices.  These are long rolls of air that spiral, or rotate one way before rotating another. They are commonly seen in clouds, creating what's known as 'cloud streets' that appear as cumulus-type clouds.As the wind moves and switches direction it causes the sand to move accordingly and create grooves and ridges in the sand.  'The dunes are aligned in the direction of the prevailing wind and are spaced 1.2 miles (2km apart)', explained Professor Hanna. 'Observations in the atmosphere and in the laboratory indicate that dominant forms of motion in the boundary layer of the atmosphere are counter-rotating helical roll vortices aligned along the wind. 'The necessary conditions for the formation of these roll vortices are fulfilled over large deserts and their spacings agree with the observed spacings of the dunes.'One theory, suggested by Steven Hanna in 1969, is that the linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices (illustrated left). These are long rolls of air that spiral, or rotate one way before rotating another. They are commonly seen in clouds, creating what's known as 'cloud streets' that appear as cumulus-type clouds align to be parallel to the wind (illustrated right)In his book, Geomorphology of Desert Dunes, Nicholas Lancaster from the Desert Research Institute argues that this theory has its flaws. He said Professor Hanna compared data on the spacing of linear dunes with the expected dimensions of helical roll vortices in subtropical desert areas, concluding their 'probable wavelength was 1.9 miles to 3.7 miles (2km to 6km).'But measured dimensions of roll vortices indicate their wavelength ranges between less than 50 metres and 31 miles (15 km).'The observed scale of helical roll vortices is in many cases much larger than average dune spacing, suggesting that linear dunes are not the product of such atmospheric motions,' explained Mr Lancaster. 'Evidence for the existence of helical roll vortices in linear dune landscapes is slight. The theory is attractive but there is little empirical data to support it in dune area.'Ridges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand and gravel. Linear dunes in the Namib Naukluft National Park, Namibia are shown. The dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sandAnother theory believes Barchan evolution may play a role. 'Barchans' are crescent-shaped sand dunes (top left) that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind. If windblown sand comes from one direction, a dune will be a crescent-shaped barchan but if winds switch direction seasonally they become linear (pictured left centre and in Morocco right)While in the 'Formation of the complex linear dunes in the central Taklimakan sand sea, China' study, Chinese researcher Xunming Wang and his colleagues said that in the case of 'complex' linear dunes - that are a combination of two shapes - the theory of Barchan evolution may play a role. 'Barchans' are crescent-shaped sand dunes that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind.The shapes depend on the wind's direction, and if windblown sand comes from one direction, for example, a dune will be a crescent-shaped barchan but if winds switch direction seasonally - coming from the southwest for half the year and from the southeast for the other half, for instance - this dune will be linear. If wind direction is more varied, star-shaped dunes appear.The Erg Chech features both compound and complex linear, as well as star dunes. Erg' comes from the Arabic word for 'field of sand dunes'Mr Wang said: 'Complex linear dune formation is shown to have five stages. 'Analysis clearly shows that under the control of wind regime, sand supply and other factors, the simple linear dunes move sideways while they evolve. ' The evolutionary processes of complex linear dunes in the region partly support the theory of 'barchan evolution' but do not support the 'roll-vortex' and 'bimodal wind regime' hypotheses.'The researchers continued that after the complex linear dunes develop,  local wind patterns and the amount of sand suggest it is possible for them to maintain their linear shape, rather than evolving into star shapes for example, even as wind direction changes. The Erg Chech features both compound and complex linear, as well as star dunes.", "ref": "The image of the patterned stripes in the Saharan Desert was captured by the Nasa's Landsat 7 satellite..

He was barely heard of then. How right Thorpe was, for what Root has done since Sydney speaks volumes about the character of the bloke.Do not be fooled by the boyish grin and cheeky demeanour. He is as steely as they come, a fierce competitor who loves playing for England. He tells himself every day that he must enjoy the game but that takes nothing away from the quality of his magnificent performances.His last five hundreds have been in excess of 149, four of them have been unbeaten and in the way he batted with Jimmy Anderson yesterday he showed he has a very good cricket brain. And he hasn't messed with his form either. It would be easy in his current run to chip up a catch on 40 or give it away as soon as he reaches a hundred, as Marlon Samuels did in the first innings here. I love the way Root goes big.Before his partner was foolishly run out, Root showed maturity to bat with the tail on Friday in GrenadaThe young batsman has been superb in his middle-order role, and should not be moved up the batting cardPart of me sees Root as a natural No 3, where England tried him in Australia. He looks like a batsman who could come in and regain the initiative if you lose an early wicket.But why move him when he is going so well at five? Keep him there. Eventually he will captain England and five is a good place to captain from.The only problem in seeing him as a future England captain is that do we want to put our best player in charge when his runs are so important?Look at Alastair Cook and just about every England captain in history. It wears them all down in the end and when the day eventually comes that England need a new leader they will have to think about that.His fabulous form should be enough to see Root left to do what he does best - score runs for EnglandAlastair Cook (right) has shown the danger of making your best player the captain of the teamI have enjoyed the battle between Ben Stokes and Samuels in this Test and I like the way the Durham lad goes about his cricket. The fact he gave Mitchell Johnson a send-off when he got him out in Australia speaks volumes for him and he'll never take a backward step.I generally don't like send-offs. Once a batsman is out you have done your job so why point to the dressing room or swear at someone? But I enjoyed what Samuels did on the third evening. If you are going to do it, make it humorous and non-threatening like that salute. Stokes will have to take it. If you dish it out you have to take it back.Stokes shouldn't go too far, though. I saw Peter Moores take him to one side for a chat before play yesterday and that might have been to say: 'Be careful. Don't lose your passion but don't do anything stupid.'", "ref": "Joe Root has been terrific to bounce back from a difficult time in Australia.. Root's 182* in the first innings in Grenada showed he is a steely competitor.. He looks a natural No 3, but England shouldn't move him from current spot.. The captaincy always wears players down, and it isn't his time yet.. Ben Stokes is right to be passionate, but needs to keep his cool as well.", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 6.0, "accuracy": 7.0, "coverage": 6.0, "coherence": 7.0, "bert_score_p":

Jondrew Lachaux, from Las Vegas, is married to the teenager's mother 38-year-old Kellie Phillips - they have six children together while the teen is from another relationship.Lachaux allegedly sexually assaulted the teenager and she had become pregnant, but she did not know, reports the Review Journal. A 39-year-old man impregnated his 17-year-old stepdaughter who gave birth alone at home while looking after her three-year-old sister, who then died in her care. Jondrew Lachaux (right) is married to the teenager's mother 38-year-old Kellie Phillips, (left) and assaulted her teen daughter In August, Lachaux and Phillips decided to go on a road trip in California for over six months.They rented a vehicle which did not have enough space for all the family, so they left the teen and her three-year-old sister behind. Police said the pair left the teen, who can not be named, with food and medication for the three-year-old who had breathing problems.But while they were away, the teen gave birth in her mom's bed - she did not have any medical help and did not take the newborn to the hospital.The arrest report states she told police her mother was not aware that she was raped or pregnant. The teen ran out of food and began to suffer from malnutrition along with her baby and her three-year-old sister.  She stopped breastfeeding after two months because she was so undernourished and switched to baby formula.It was during this period that the three-year-old died - the cause of the death is under investigation.The teen was left alone at the home in Las Vegas (pictured). She gave birth in her mom's bed - she did not have any medical help and did not take the newborn to the hospitalThe teen girl said after the child died she tried to text Lachaux and her mother, but they did not respond for two weeksThe teen girl said she tried to text Lachaux and her mother, but they did not respond for two weeks, reports 8NewsNow. Police said they asked her why she did not call police and she said Lachaux told her not to call 911.She told them that when she told her stepfather that the body smelt, he allegedly told her to put her little sister in a box.She wrapped the toddler in a pink blanket and put her inside a cardboard box designed to hold a stroller. When he returned on March 28, they moved the box inside a broken car in the garage and then piled pizza boxes on top.Lachaux was allegedly desperate to hide the baby's birth from his wife before she returned and gave the teen some baby formula before kicking her and the baby out from the homeShe went to a supermarket and wandered around for a few hours before walking four miles to McCarran International Airport.She spent the night there with the infant and the next day Lachaux used a fake name to book his stepdaughter a room at a motel near there - she was now only feeding the baby water because the formula had run out.Upon discovering his step-daughter had given birth, Lachaux kicked her out. She wandered the streets and the next day Lachaux used a fake name to book his stepdaughter a room at a motel (pictured) Lachaux arranged to meet her at McCarran on April 1, but airport staff called 911 when the baby began having problems, the report said.The baby was taken to Sunrise Hospital Medical Center in a critical condition and staff alerted police.The baby is now doing well in the hospital. Lachaux faces three counts of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death, and one count of destroying or concealing evidence - bail is set at $1 million. Phillips who turned herself in after a police search, faces two counts of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death.Her five children, aged between one and nine, are now in Child Protective Services. The 17-year-old faces one count of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death and one count of destroying or concealing evidence.  Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said: 'She's a juvenile, she's 17 years old. Does she need services? Does she need treatment by the juvenile system? Or should she be punished for her actions?'", "ref": "Jondrew Lachaux is married to the teenager's mother Kellie Phillips.. Lachaux allegedly sexually assaulted the teen and she became pregnant..

They pay \u00a3345 at the moment and, depending on the level they sit on, have been told to renew it will cost \u00a3975.'That is just for the same wheelchair bay. The club are turning the areas where the affected bays are into premium level seating. They clearly want a certain kind of client there, business men and the like, who they can make money from.'The Etihad club have increased season tickets for many fans ahead of next seasonMark, 49 and himself a wheelchair user, added that the only option for those who could not afford the giant hikes was to move behind the goal.'There's no option to sit at the side of the pitch which a lot of people want to do,' he explained. 'They are forcing people into a certain area.'We would like a halo of disabled bays around the ground as they have at Wembley so you can choose where to go but they won't listen to us. There's 134 of us and we are obviously not important.'City point out that they have increased the number of disabled bays to 238 and have invested in improving facilities. They are also offering new headsets for blind and partially-sighted supporters and 'super risers' which allow wheelchair users an elevated viewing position.", "ref": "Premier League champions have increased season ticket prices next term..

And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline.According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.'  This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight. A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work offIndulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work offIt may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats. For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules. A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes. One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off.The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitnessExperts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterwardTwo hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running.Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume.'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said.Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat.He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then.'What we're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time. That way when holidays, like Easter, come around they don't have to feel like they have to deny themselves,' he said.", "ref": "The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' for four mini Easter eggs it would take 30-40 minutes of walking to work off..

Jackson is a fighter!' his mother Rhonda told Daily Mail Australia.His elated family are 'over the moon' that the surgery was more of a success than they dared to even dream it would be.In recovery, Jackson opened his eyes surrounded by his surgeon and family, who had been trying to prepare themselves for bad news.Jackson Byrnes, 18, underwent a risky operation to remove the tumour on his brain on Wednesday. it has been an enormous successRenowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia who was willing to perform the risky operation that will hopefully buy Jackson more time'The surgeon told Jackson to try and lift up his arm. And he did! Like that! We couldn't believe it,' his mother said.'And then he turned his head to the surgeon, Dr Teo, and said thank you. It was such a beautiful moment.'Jackson's story made national headlines this week, with strangers digging deep to help the family, donating more than $95,000 in just over a week.Thousands of people helped to fund Jackson's $80,000 operation and contribute to other medical costs.On Wednesday, his loved ones waited for seven anxious hours as world-renowned surgeon Dr Charlie Teo operated on the teen at the Prince of Wales hospital in Sydney's east.Three weeks ago the teen from Casino in NSW's north was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page to help fun the crucial $80,000 operation His family refused to accept the dismal diagnosis and took matters into their own hands and found Dr Teo, who said he was willing to perform the operation if the family understood the risks. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo was the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see the Casino teenager paralysed.  'We were told he would probably wake up and be paralysed down his left side. That was so hard to hear but we really had no choice in the end,' Rhonda told Daily Mail Australia.  'We would have lost him, we had to take that chance.''I didn't know where the hell I'd get the money, I just knew I have it no matter what. I would have gone to the ends of the earth for him,' Rhonda said. Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia that he hopes the surgery will buy the teen more time. 'If you can buy him time with surgery then the hope is you're going to get a good response to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a significant extension of time,' he said.'Even if we could buy him six months of life the hope is we're going to come up with new treatment in that time.'Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard.The 18-year-old (pictured left, getting his head shaved) at a recent fundraising eventThe Byrnes family have already endured the 'four weeks from hell'.It was an emotion-filled moment on Wednesday morning as they waited for Jackson to go into theatre at 9.30am.'We all had so much anxiety before the surgery. It was a seven hour long procedure and the unknown was driving me crazy,' said Rhonda on Wednesday night.'Before he went in he said he was anxious. Not knowing what he's up for.''He was a bit upset before the surgery. He went really quiet. We were trying not to be scared,' said his 17-year-old little brother Maton.'But everyone was just focussed on believing that he was going to come out of the surgery alright.'It was a tense wait for his family and loved ones.'I couldn't stop thinking about him in there all by himself, even though I knew he was in the best of hands,' said Rhonda. Jackson needs $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his surgery upfront, and another $45,00 for feesBut it wasn't long before the Byrnes family were laughing again.Rhonda couldn't believe it when, after such an intense surgery, her cheeky son was back to his old tricks.She had quickly ducked away from the hospital after visiting her son in recovery. Jackson's name popped up on Rhonda's phone screen.'I thought it would be his girlfriend Jahnae calling to update me on his condition after such an intense surgery,' Rhonda said.'Instead I heard Jackson's voice and he said to me: \"Mum, hi! What are you up to? I feel great, but I'm really hungry,\"' Rhonda laughs.'He was just talking like normal and looking for food. We had been to told to expect he'd be paralysed!There is still a long road to go for young Jackson, much of it unknown.'Four weeks ago he was a fit young fellow and had his own future ahead of him,' Rhonda said.Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain 'He's still fighting, it is overwhelming.'The family have gained strength from the love and support they have received from thousands of people who have rallied around them.'It's incredible to have everyone coming together for us. Our phone has been running hot, even from strangers calling wanting to help however they can or see how Jackson is,' said Rhonda.'It makes us so happy. I don't know how we could have done it without 'Team Jacko'.Jackson's heartbroken mother Rhonda had been told the incredibly risky surgery.After a tense seven hour long wake, Jackson woke But when Jackson woke up, the was told to try and lift his left arm and he did!Then he turned his head to Dr Teo and said thank you.It was such a beautiful moment.At the end of a long day,We all had so much anxiety before the surgery. It was a seven hour long procedure and the unknown was driving me crazy.'Before he went in he said he was anxious. Not knowing what he's up for.'Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery'He was a bit upset before the surgery. He went really quiet. We were trying not to be scared,' said his 17-year-old little brother Maton.'But everyone was just focussed on believing that he was going to come out of the surgery alright.'It was a tense wait for his family and loved ones.I couldn't stop thinking about him in there all by himself, even though I knew he was in the best of hands.No one else would operate, they wouldn't even attempt. It was an enormous relief when Dr Teo took on his surgery, words can't describe the relief.The response from everybody \u2013 including so many strangers \u2013 has been amazing,Dr Teo had predicted that he would remove 95 per cent of the tumour. Most of the tumour has been successfully removed but the Byrnes family are yet exactly how much.Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI", "ref": "Doctors found Jackson Byrnes' aggressive brain tumour three weeks ago.. Only one surgeon in Australia, Dr Charlie Teo, was willing to operate.. More than $95,000 was raised for Jackson by strangers to pay for the $80,000 surgery and help fund his treatment.. It was expected Jackson would wake paralysed from the extremely risky op.. Instead, he woke up and moved his arms, head and thanked Dr Teo.. It's hoped the operation has bought him more time.", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 2.0, "accuracy": 7.0, "coverage": 1.0, "coherence": 7.0, "bert_score_p": 0.3312976360321045, "bert_score_r":

The group said the activists would not interfere with thevessel's navigation.Scroll down for video  On the rig: Greenpeace activists scale the Polar Pioneer drill rig in the Pacific OceanMap: The activists boarded the rig just 750 miles northwest of Hawaii as it makes its journey to the ArcticAt dawn on Monday, the six, from the USA, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Austria, sped towards the Polar Pioneer in inflatable boats launched from the Greenpeace ship EsperanzaClimbers: All Greenpeace activists aboard the rig are experienced climbers and say they don't plan to interfere with the ship's course'We're here to highlight that in less than 100 days Shell isgoing to the Arctic to drill for oil,' 32-year-old Johno Smith,one of the six to board the Blue Marlin, the ship carrying therig, said in the statement.'Shell's actions are exploiting the melting ice to increasea man-made disaster. Climate change is real,' he added.Shell said in an emailed statement that it has met withgroups against oil drilling off Alaska's shores and 'respecttheir views' but condemned the boarding.'We can confirm that protesters from Greenpeace haveillegally boarded the Polar Pioneer, under contract to Shell,jeopardizing not only the safety of the crew on board, but theprotesters themselves,' Shell said.The move comes just days after the U.S. Interior Departmentupheld a 2008 lease sale in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska, movingShell a step closer to returning to oil and gas exploration inthe Arctic since it suffered mishaps in the region in 2012.The people vs shell: The activists hope they will draw media attention to oil drilling in the ArcticReveal a list: Greenpeace activists scale the Polar Pioneer drill rig in the Pacific Ocean to unfurl a banner with the names of millions of people opposed to Arctic drillingLong haul: The activists used ropes and climbing equipment to scale the 38,000-tonne platformMany environmentalists oppose offshore energy exploration inthe Arctic, saying that once production begins any oil spillwould be extremely difficult to clean up.Oil industry interests say the Arctic will be important tothe United States' energy security in coming decades when outputfrom shale formations is expected to wane.Images published by Greenpeace showed the activists usingclimbing gear to move from an inflatable boat onto the BlueMarlin heavy-lift vessel towing the Pioneer, one of two drillrigs heading to the region, as it cruised some 750 miles (1,207km) northwest of Hawaii.The six activists planned to camp on the 38,000-tonne Polar Pioneer platform, which they boarded using inflatable boats from the Greenpeace vessel 'Esperanza.'Tweeting from the rig: Aliyah Field tweeted she'd love some coffee but that the sunrise over the Pacific is gorgeous even from the side of the oil rigMany names: Aliyah maybe referring to the list of names the activists will hang showing all the people who are opposed to oil drilling in the arctic The six -- from the United States, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Austria -- have supplies for several days and can communicate with the outside world, Greenpeace said.'We made it! We're on Shell's platform. And we're not alone. Everyone can help turn this into a platform for people power!' tweeted one of the six, Aliyah Field.Johno Smith from New Zealand added: 'We're here to highlight that in less than 100 days Shell is going to the Arctic to drill for oil.'This pristine environment needs protecting for future generations and all life that will call it home.

When it was measured it was reading UTC time to within a quarter of a second.The National Maritime Museum confirmed the record on Twitter yesterday.It wrote: 'Our 100 day trail of \"Clock B\" won @GWR for \"most accurate mechanical clock with a pendulum swinging in free air\"!'Rory McEvoy, the Observatory's curator of horology, added: 'What we've seen here is something approaching a perfect clock, but we are not there yet.'Harrison died in 1776. He has since been the subject of Dava Sobel's bestselling book Longitude, as well as a film with the same name starring Michael Gambon (right) and Jeremy Irons (left)John Harrison was a carpenter born in 1693 in Lincolnshire.In the early 18th century a lot of Royal Navy ships were being lost at sea. Although latitude was relatively easy to determine using the sun, longitude was harder.The problem was considered so important Parliament offered financial rewards of up to \u00a320,000 to anyone who solved it.Clockmakers argued that a heavy pendulum bob and short swing would be the best. But Harrison dismissed this theory and thought a clock with a lighter pendulum bob and wide swing would work better. He designed his first clock in 1713 aged 20.His 'longitude' clock, which was the basis of the Martin Burgess Clock B, would solve the problem of determining longitude at sea, he claimed.By knowing the amount of time the ship had been at sea and the local time by using the sun, sailors would be able to determine longitude accurately. Local time is one hour ahead for every 15 degrees of longitude east and one hour behind for every 15 degrees of longitude west. He was not taken seriously by any of his contemporaries and the possibilities of his clock were not explored until the 20th century.Harrison died in 1776. He has since been the subject of Dava Sobel's bestselling book Longitude, as well as a film with the same name starring Michael Gambon and Jeremy Irons.", "ref": "Martin Burgess Clock b is based on John Harrison's 18th century design..

Their carcasses lie in thick bush grass and some are still covered in dark brown fur with gun shot wounds clearly visible. There have been reports that the remains of the animals are scattered over an area of 200m around the reserve and no efforts have been made to conceal them.  The 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking about. Police found a .22 calibre gun, ammunition and a baseball bat in the woman's home. The couple, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday.A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun at the bush site in nearby Coonarr.The 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on ThursdayLocal speculation suggests the site is a common dumping ground for `wasted' dogs used by people in the industry.Police haven't been able to confirm reports that microchips were also discovered. The shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent'.Post-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity as well.' And it's unlikely to be the last horrific sight he and his colleagues are met with.'We've not even tipped the iceberg yet,' he said on Thursday morning.The carcasses were in various states of decomposition when found by a member of the public 360 kilometres north of Brisbane in Vera Scarth-Johnson Wildflower Reserve, and it is thought that the site is a common dumping ground for unwanted racing greyhounds'It could be somebody within the industry that knows the remoteness of that area up there and knows that it's a safe place to dispose of greyhounds that can't perform within the greyhound industry,' he said before the couple were arrested. Speaking to 9News, local resident Lloyd Blake said: 'We're quite disgusted that the dogs were dumped in our area and we hope at the end of the day that the severe fire that we had here in November is not related to the burning of the dogs.'Fires ripped through the area in February and police are now investigating whether the fires were deliberately lit and linked to the burning of the greyhound carcasses. It's also believed the animals were killed prior to the ABC's live baiting expose, judging by the level of decomposition.Racing Queensland's own probe into the use of live piglets, possums, rabbits and other small animals to train race dogs has resulted in more than 30 trainers being banned or stood down pending an internal review.The 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking aboutThe shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent'It's not yet known if any of those banned or suspended are those operating around Bundaberg that have been identified by police.But Queensland Greyhound Breeders, Owners and Trainers Association president Tony Zammit maintains the wider industry has been tarnished by the action of a few 'villains and rogues'.While horrified to learn of the mass killing, he said comments it foreshadowed even more revelations of animal mistreatment were premature.'To me, it's an exaggerated statement,' he said.'We haven't heard the full story yet.'Speaking at a press conference Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller was furious and appalled at the 'mass murder'.'The people who have perpetrated this crime to me are oxygen thieves , they are cowards and they are pathetic,' she said. Bundaberg Greyhound Club president Stephen Bland took to Facebook to express shock at the discovery.Post-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity as well'Australia has one of the largest greyhound racing industries in the world. Live baiting has been banned and criminalised for decades.@QPSmedia@RSPCAQld 'We are appalled by the news and are doing all we can to find whomever is responsible for this disgraceful act,' he said.Greyhounds usually have relaxed, amicable temperaments and the state's Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller used social media to note her outrage.'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia & @RSPCAQld have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she tweeted.Australia has one of the largest greyhound racing industries in the world.

THE SECOND FIGHT OF THE CENTURYJoe Frazier v Muhammad AliMadison Square Garden, New YorkMarch 8, 1971The Greatest had been stripped of the world heavyweight title he had won so sensationally against Sonny Liston but it was the reason for that decision which added cultural significance to what was to be a magnificent fight. Sweat sprays off Muhammad Ali (right) as Joe Frazier collects his jaw with a strong left in 1971Ali and Frazier at Madison Square Garden, New York, on March 8, 1971, was the second 'Fight of the Century'Ali's evasive abilities and speed, such as this swerve from a Frazier hook, kept him in the fightSmokin' Joe was the undefeated two-belt champion but it was this proud black man's bizarre adoption by America's conservative right which stoked the fires of society still further.Muhammad Ali had been banned from boxing for three-and-a-half years for refusing induction into the US military to fight in Vietnam \u2013 but as a consequence become the darling of the young, the black and the Civil Rights movement.Joe Frazier found himself unwittingly the standard bearer for the white establishment. Ali fanned the flames by labelling the simpler man who would become his arch-rival an 'Uncle Tom,' the most wounding insult for an African AmericanThere was a foretaste of the current scramble for Mayweather-Pacquaio tickets. Woody Allen was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the Garden.Frank Sinatra persuaded Life magazine to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer. Fast-talking Ali offensively labelled Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' due to the support he got from white conservatives Referee Tony Perez, widely believed to have acted leniently in Ali's favour, orders the pair to their cornersJACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIESJuly 4, 1910, Reno, NevadaJOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELINGJune 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York Author Norman Mailer reported on the fight.Actor Burt Lancaster picked up a TV microphone for his only stint as a colour commentator.Artist Leroy Neiman sat at his easel painting Ali and Frazier as they fought.This was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history.Ali came out fast to dominate the first three rounds. Frazier, encouraged by catching Ali with the last punch of the third, launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy. Ali's speed of hand, dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment \u2013 along with a little help from referee Arthur Mercante who declined to call a knock down when Frazier sent him crashing in the eighth. Ali is laid out on the canvas as Frazier is send to the corner before a long 10-count in the 15th round Somehow, heroically, survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds.Still some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round. There all argument was ended.Frazier caught him with the most wicked of all those trademark left hooks and this time there was no denying a count which appeared to edge a fraction longer than the stipulated ten seconds. Ali rose to his feet. Unsteadily. His jaw grotesquely swollen. Again his courage carried him to the bell.The decision was unanimously in favour of Frazier, although both men went to hospital.Frazier got the unanimous decision from the judges but both men went to hospital after the epic boutVery late that night word spread through New York's animated bars that one of them had died.Frazier checked out early, quietly.Ali pronounced the rumours of his passing to be premature.Their trilogy was born. They were to fight twice more and on one of those occasions each would come close to death again.", "ref": "Floyd Mayweather jr and Manny Pacquiao's fight will be the richest ever..

Hands up: Plastic Lego figures are being used by police as part of a quirky campaign to warn people about the dangers of housebreaking. But the move received a backlash, with victims branding it as 'a joke'The police internet posting showed scenes of Lego criminals attempting to break into people's homes before being arrested by officers \u2013 and were accompanied by a Scots dialect poem giving advice.But the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes.Break-ins in Edinburgh rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to April 2014, with 4,101 homes hit. Across Scotland, housebreakings rose 4 per cent to 22,272 over the same period.The row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations, rather than pounding the beat.Last year, critics claimed many officers were having to 'backfill' \u2013 being taken off beat duties to carry out office jobs previously covered by civilian workers.Be vigilant: The Lego figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people's homes. Last night Police Scotland defended the campaignLast night, Police Scotland defended the campaign, pointing out that the photos have been viewed almost 350,000 times.But Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: 'With housebreaking on the increase, officers should be out solving real crimes, rather than relying on Lego to try and prevent it.'The pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive, Operation RAC. They were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling the city's housebreaking problem.One image shows a Lego figurine in a hat and standing beside a door. Another shows a man standing on a ledge with another figure below.Poems were posted alongside the pictures, with one reading: 'Staying in or goin oot? Lock the windaes 'n' front door. A simple step maybe, that'll prevent access tae them on the chore.''Keep yer hame safe when yer oot on the go,By usin' timers on lights 'n' even the radio,Timers are cheap 'n' it takes seconds tae do,And it cuid prevent ye fae calling the boys in blue.''Look how ye get access tae the back o' yer hame,If it's easy others wull dae the same, Restrict access tae the rear,And help prevent others fae choring yer gear.'One victim of housebreaking, Tamara Swanson from Newhaven, Edinburgh, was not impressed.The 20-year-old was alone in her home last July when an intruder attacked her as she was getting out of the shower. The man grabbed her from behind, punched her and then tried to strangle her before she managed to escape.Speaking last night, she said police had done little to help her since the incident.'We had to keep phoning them [Police Scotland],' she said. 'I'm still going to a psychiatrist and they're putting a lot of anxiety down to this. I wasn't sleeping for months. I didn't feel safe at all.'Speaking about the online campaign, she said: 'They're [people online] not going to look at it and think, \"That's interesting\" and do anything about it.'Her father, Peter Swanson, added: 'Why would they bother doing that? Lego? It's a joke. Police Scotland is a waste of time.'It's a money-saving thing, obviously to the detriment of policing. The cartoons are stupid. Get the guys back on the street.'Another housebreaking victim, Michael Wright said the pictures were 'terrible' and 'insensitive'.His house in the Inch area of Edinburgh was broken into just before Christmas, with thieves taking money he had set aside for presents, as well as his Ford Fiesta.Mr Wright, whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident, said: 'Could they not have used the resources elsewhere, rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with Lego sets?'When I saw that, I thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries. They have nothing better to be doing than sitting behind their computer on Facebook.'Watch out: The campaign was shared on social media with fun poems. Pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling Edinburgh's housebreaking problemHe added: 'Most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s. They don't have Facebook or social media, so how are they supposed to get the message?'Chief Supt Mark Williams, Edinburgh divisional commander, said: 'Over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages.'Social media is an important tool for communicating with the public. It allows us to provide vital information on crime prevention and advice on keeping safe.'", "ref": "Officers posted pictures of Lego models on their Facebook page..

And now the firm has announced it is cutting his pay.In his prime: GoPro creator Nick Woodman, 39, is set to be named America's highest-paid CEO of 2014 Woodman's product - a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, or a hand-held pole - made waves in when it debuted in 2006. They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering six-foot waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps.The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife Jill giving birth to one of their sons. The Californian surfing couple have come a long way since the business was founded in 2004 with one product: a waterproof film camera.Before sales took off, Woodman posed as the model for their self-made adverts.But his posing days didn't last long.In 2006, the firm launched its first digital camera. Three years later it began selling a high-definition camera. The cameras are light, small and waterproof. They have other uses besides sports. TV producers use them to film in areas where big professional cameras can't go.Since launching its high-definition camera in 2009, it has sold 8.5 million of them, including 3.8 million in 2013. Its cameras are sold in more than 25,000 stores and cost between $200 and $400. The day the company first went public, they sold 3.6 million shares of GoPro stock to rake in an astounding $86 million before taxes.

As stock prices continue to increase, and including some of Woodman's other assets, Forbes estimates that his net worth is now more than $2.3 billion.Chinese tech manufacturer Foxconn, which owns about 11 million shares of GoPro stock that are worth a collective $425 million. Riverwood Capital, a private equity firm, currently has about $650 million in GoPro stock.Nick Woodman is the founder and CEO of GoPro, a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, equipment or a hand-held pole.They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering 6ft waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps.The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife giving birth to one of their sons.They are WiFi capable, typically come with remotes for control and have a capacity of 64GB currently.They are also versatile thanks to numerous add-ons, including LCD screens, and the most expensive model is $400. Woodman's father, Dean, has also found himself an overnight millionaire. The elder Woodman loaned his son $200,000 to help get GoPro off the ground.Dean Woodman - who sold none of his shares at the IPO - now owns $280 million in GoPro shares. As Forbes notes, that is a 140,000 percent return on his initial $200,000 investment.  Its list of competitors is short, but growing. Consumer electronics companies Garmin, Samsung and Sony have all entered the market.GoPro had the best-selling camcorder in 2013, according to government paperwork filed by the company.It also sells accessories such as cases, battery packs and mounts that help users attach their cameras to surfboards, helmets or their wrists. It also has a free app and software that lets users edit, store and publish their videos to their social media accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.Additional growth may come from the wild videos its cameras create, which the company hopes to use to create a media company.

Fighting back: Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quitVictims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling \u2013 even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution. Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched  - but decided it was now too late to charge him.She told the Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review.'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist. 'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions. 'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.'Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trialLast night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial.Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute.In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry.But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease.Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state. And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year.The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed.The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation.The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home.In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances.Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raidEven earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords.A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them.This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988.Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts.Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial.He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'.Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in publicSigned: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasonsMr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.'Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered.This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.'A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'. At least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010.Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial", "ref": "Alison Saunders won't quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue' head of CPS decided against pressing charges against Lord Janner..

Then he got quiet when he was bleeding out.'Mr Ryan, a married father-of-two, was taken to Staten Island University before being transferred by air ambulance to the trauma unit at Belleview hospital, FDNY sources told the New York Post.He has lost one leg, but is expected to live, a UPS representative said.The driver of the Toyota, which had North Carolina licence plates, told officers he swerved to avoid a pedestrian, according to law enforcement sources.Mr Sattar backed up this account, adding that the driver was believed to be a teenager.The NYPD said no charges were filed against the driver.He said the jaywalker stopped to rubberneck but left before emergency services reached the scene.According to Mr Ryan's Facebook page, his son, Malachy, believed to be aged eight or nine, was hit by a bus around four years ago while walking home from school.Malachy was a 'bloody mess' and needed a neck brace, but doctors said 'he would be OK', he wrote.Scene: Mr Ryan was struck by this black Toyota while making deliveries on Staten Island, leaving his other leg hanging by a thread.

Green Party activists have been told to dress in 'mainstream' fashion while knocking on doors in a bid to win over sceptical voters.A manual for the party's supporters urges them to appear 'level headed' and 'agreeable' \u2013 and even encourages them to compliment people's homes.The advice, which has been distributed among Green campaigners in London, also provides stock answers to ease voters' concerns about their radical plans to dismantle the army, legalise drugs and pay everybody \u00a372 a week no matter how rich they are.A Green campaigning manual urges activists to dress in 'mainstream' fashion - unlike the campaigners pictured with the party's only MP Caroline Lucas at a fracking protest at Balcombe, West Sussex (above)It comes amid growing scrutiny of the Green Party's manifesto commitments after its membership surged to more than 50,000, outnumbering the Liberal Democrats and Ukip.But the party's surge in support was hit by a series of disastrous media appearances from the party's leader Natalie Bennett in which she struggled to explain her key policies.In February she suffered what she called a 'brain fade' on LBC Radio when she forgot the details of her party's key housing policies.Ms Bennett endured another tough interview yesterday - and was forced to defend her proposal to give every adult in Britain a guaranteed weekly income.She admitted the so-called 'citizens income' \u2013 which critics say would cost \u00a3280billion \u2013 would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer.Ms Bennett also admitted that another Green pledge \u2013 to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines \u2013 was also a 'long-term aspiration'. The party also supports leaving Nato and abandoning nuclear weapons.The Green manual for volunteers aims to ease voters' concerns over the party's radical platform.", "ref": "Series of model letters  drawn up with carefully pre-crafted messages..

Police confirmed his body was found in a septic tank near the family home March 26From left; Virginia State Police Lt. Ed Murphy, Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis, Pulaski County Commonwealth Attorney, Mike Fleenor, during a press conference Thursday announcing the arrest of White and ThomasAfter an intense-five days search, the child's body was found in a septic tank on White and Thomas' property.'It came to a point where the evidence that we had we felt was sufficient to arrest them for probable cause,' said Commonwealth's Attorney Mike Fleenor of Pulaski County, reported Indianapolis Star. The couple's 6-month-old daughter was removed from their home and placed in the custody of social services the day after Noah's body was recovered.White and Thomas were each charged with two counts of neglect and abuse involving Noah and his baby sister.During their arraignment via teleconference Friday, both suspects objected to the presence of reporters in the courtroom. 'This is the saddest thing that's ever happened to me in my life,' White was quoted as saying. 'I don't feel people should be able to enjoy it over dinner.'Her boyfriend sounded a similar note, saying that he doesn't want his life to be a news story. The judge, however, allowed members of the media to stay in the room.They are being held in jail without bond pending a court hearing scheduled for August 12.Investigators are now waiting for the medical examiner's office to release the results of Noah's autopsy to shed light on the cause of death, which could take weeks, if not months. Search crews have looked around the boy's house. His mother could not find him after she woke up at 10Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road near Noah's house, which is 'never typical'White said Noah, pictured left with his dad and right, was a cautious child who would not have run away Noah Thomas was last seen alive sitting in his parents' living room and watching cartoons at 9am March 22. His mother took her baby daughter, Abigail, to another room and settled in for a nap. More than an hour later, she woke up to find the back door open and Noah gone. Nearly five days later, an FBI-backed search concluded with the discovery of Noah's lifeless body in a septic tank near the family home. Police and more than 100 volunteers who signed up to look for Noah in the small town had covered about 3.3 square miles after the 60lb red-headed boy was reported missing.Pulaski County Sheriff Jim Davis said at the time that authorities have no evidence of foul play in his disappearance, and that the family have cooperated with authorities.Investigators said search dogs stopped near the road adjacent to Noah's house, which is 'never typical'.No suspicious vehicles were seen in the area.  Crews used helicopters in the search in the area, which is mostly residential with farmland and a woods by the boy's house.  Ashley White, who called police at 11am after searching for her child on her own, said that the boy was cautious and had no history of running away.Stephanie Ide Hudgins, Paul Thomas' sister, described her brother and his partner as 'the best parents, hands down,' reported Roanoke Times. High school sweethearts: White and Thomas (pictured left and right) met in junior high school but did not start dating until high school Touched by tragedy: The couple lost a good friend in a deadly abduction in 2000, and White's father was later murdered Proud dad: Thomas' sister said her brother and his partner were very excited about having a baby togehter. Thomas pictured here with Noah not long after his birth Hudgins, a mother of four, said she would often call Ashley if she had any questions about child-rearing.Noah's aunt detailed how Thomas and White met in junior high school but did not start dating until high school.The couple have been touched by tragedy in the past.A friend who helped arrange their first date, Tara Rose Munsey, disappeared in January 2000 from her job at a Taco Bell. Her body was discovered in a ravine two weeks later. She was 16 years old.Some years later, White's father was murdered and her mother became gravely ill.Before the mother's passing, White and Thomas decided to have a baby together.'They were so excited to have Noah,' Hudgins said. 'Noah was special anyways, before he even came into this earth.'", "ref": "Ashley White, 30, and Paul Thomas, 32, charged with child abuse and neglect ..

The Scottish National Party has pledged to vote in favour of a 50p top rate if it holds the balance of power after May 7.But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is said to want the new top rate to be temporary, while Mr Miliband is more ideologically wedded to maintaining it. During the Labour leadership race in 2010, Mr Miliband said the 50p rate should stay in place and was 'not just about reducing the deficit, it's about fairness in our society'.Today, in an interview with with the New Statesman magazine, shadow business secretary Mr Umunna broke ranks to insist that how long to sustain the measure should be a purely economic decision and not a moral one.'I wouldn't want to do it permanently because ... I would like to see the tax burden as low as possible,' he said. 'I don't believe that you tax for the sake of taxing: you tax to fund public services and, currently, to reduce our deficit and our debt.'I'm very clear: I did not go into politics to tax people. We should be very clear about that as a party.'Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, speaking in Birmingham today, is said to want the new top rate to be temporary, while Mr Miliband is more ideologically wedded to maintaining itDuring the Labour leadership race in 2010, Ed Miliband - pictured campaigning in north London today, said the 50p rate should stay in place and was 'not just about reducing the deficit, it's about fairness in our society'Mr Umunna also argued that Labour needs to make a more positive and confident case for reducing the deficit in order to cope with the Left-wing backlash it would encounter in office.'I don't think there is anything progressive in spending more on your debt interest repayments every year than you do on housing, than you do on transport,' he said. 'That is where there is an argument from a progressive position to be made for balancing the books. We need to make that argument and we need to make it more confidently.'Because if we get elected . . . we're going to have to make some really tough decisions. And we need to be clear why we're doing this - we will be attacked from the left, not just by the Green Party but the Socialist Party and others, and we've got to have a confident, not a defensive position.'Asked whether he would like to be Labour leader, Mr Umunna failed to rule it out. 'I always listen to Tessa Jowell, who's like my political mum, who says you've got to keep your feet firmly on the ground and for every person who writes up something like that there'll be another slagging you off,' said the 36-year-old.'So I think you've got to keep a sense of perspective and you've got to remember in politics that it isn't about you, it's actually about the ideas, the arguments and the party.'Mr Balls yesterday published an audit of spending and tax commitments in the Conservative Party manifesto which he claims shows the Tories have made \u00a325 billion a year of promises which they have not explained how they will pay for.In a speech in the West Midlands, Labour's Shadow Chancellor will say that this \u00a325 billion is the equivalent of \u00a31,439 a year for every working household in Britain.'The Conservative Party manifesto contains billions of pounds of panicky promises with absolutely no idea where the money is coming from,' he said.Chancellor George Osborne has rejected Mr Balls's criticisms of the Tory manifesto as 'absurd'. He has refused to rule out reducing the top tax rate back down to 40p, where it was during Tony Blair's entire period of office.", "ref": "Mr Umunna said he was opposed to 'taxing for the sake of taxing' business secretary said re-introduction of the rate should be temporary..

The Navy has been beefing up its presence in the Gulf of Aden and the southern Arabian Sea amid reports that about eight Iranian ships are heading toward Yemen and possibly carrying arms.The USS Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (background), was dispatched to the Gulf of Aden to blockade an Iranian flotilla carrying arms. The carrier is pictured here with the USS Vicksburg cruiser - similar to the USS Normandy which was also sent to the Gulf of AdenThe guided missile cruiser USS Normandy is pictured here. The cruiser is escorting the Roosevelt to the Gulf of AdenNavy officials said there are about nine U.S. warships in the region, including cruisers and destroyers carrying teams that can board and search other vessels.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ship movement on the record.But speaking to Reuters on Monday, a Pentagon spokesman  denied the ships were on a mission to intercept Iranian arms shipments.One U.S. official said the presence of the U.S. warships off Yemen give American decision-makers options for action in the event the situation deteriorates.The other U.S. warships in the region include two destroyers, two mine-sweepers and three amphibious ships carrying 2,200 U.S. Marines.The Shi'ite Muslim Houthi are battling government-backed fighters in an effort to take control of the country.The Houthi fighters sidelined the central government after seizing the capital Sana'a in September and expanding across Yemen, which borders oil giant Saudi Arabia.Closing in: The USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy left the Persian Gulf on Sunday (seen on the map) and are heading through the Arabian Sea towards Yemen, according to reportsThe U.S. has been providing logistical and intelligence support to a Saudi Arabia-led coalition, which has been launching airstrikes against the Houthis. That air campaign is now in its fourth week.The U.S. Navy generally conducts consensual boardings of ships when needed, including to combat piracy around Africa and the region. So far, however, U.S. naval personnel have not boarded any Iranian vessels since the Yemen conflict began.White House spokesman Josh Earnest would not comment specifically on any Navy movements in Yemeni waters, but said the U.S. has concerns about Iran's 'continued support for the Houthis'.'We have seen evidence that the Iranians are supplying weapons and other armed support to the Houthis in Yemen,' he said. 'That support will only contribute to greater violence in that country. 'These are exactly the kind of destabilizing activities that we have in mind when we raise concerns about Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East.'He said 'the Iranians are acutely aware of our concerns for their continued support of the Houthis by sending them large shipments of weapons'.", "ref": "USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Normandy left Persian Gulf on Sunday and are steaming through the Arabian Sea and heading towards Yemen..

It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of \"moral\" to most of my constituents.'In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children.Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly.Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals.He said: 'I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties.'One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.'", "ref": "London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment..

We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.'Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player's contract stand-off.Pulis said: 'Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European ChampionshipsBerahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for.'If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.'Pulis added: 'I can't speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here.'There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.'", "ref": "Pulis has spoken with his striker about pre-season plans..

The photos show the former governor sitting at a desk, reading a book and wearing glasses and sitting outside in shorts and a wife beater shirt.While he continues to awaiting word on a last-ditch appeal, Blagojevich has daily contact with his family and teaches the history of war battles to other inmates, his attorney said.Last July lawyers attempted to argue that a high court ruling in McCutcheon v. the Federal Election Commission in April 2014 bolstered their view that Blagojevich was engaged in legal, run-of-the-mill political horse trading, not corruption.The McCutcheon ruling, they argued, found that soliciting contributions crosses the line into corruption only when a politician makes a clear, explicit promise to take official action in return for a donation.Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver after he was caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected presidentIn that context, defense attorneys said the trial judge was wrong to set a lower standard for jurors by telling them, to convict, they only needed to find that Blagojevich sought donations 'knowing or believing' it would be given for some official act.But government attorneys responded saying that Blagojevich's legal team hadn't correctly characterized the Supreme Court's findings in McCutcheon.'The decision provides no support for Blagojevich's argument on appeal,' the two-page filing said. 'Nothing in the (McCutcheon) decision suggests that an exchange of contributions for specific official acts is quid pro quo corruption only if the arrangement is stated 'explicitly' or 'expressly.''The Chicago-based appellate court has been considering Blagojevich's appeal for more than a year months. It's unclear when it might issue a decision.", "ref": "The former Illinois governor has been photographed in prison for the first time since starting his 14 year sentence in 2012 ..

'You can feel allthat cynicism with this gate.'He studied pictures and documents about the original gate,which was installed in 1936, and used techniques likehigh-temperature brazing, which was more common than solderingin the 1930s.More than 200,000 people had been detained in the camp bythe time U.S. troops liberated it in 1945.

But we did well, we had Jonjo sent off so we were never going to go gung-ho and we got a good point.'We did well in the circumstances and now we want to go one better and get all three.'", "ref": "Everton have won their last three games and visit Swansea on Saturday..

Coltrane on TV's \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88.Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague.Although he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when \"The Dukes of Hazzard's\" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night.For seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his \"hot pursuit\" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car.Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive \"kew-kew-kew\" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as \"cuff 'em and stuff 'em!\" upon making an arrest.Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games.Several of Best's \"Hazzard\" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media.\"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,\" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. \"Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend.\"\"Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,\" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. \"Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions.\"Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career.In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gunsmoke.\" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including \"Hooper\" and \"The End.\"But Best will always be best known for his \"Hazzard\" role, which lives on in reruns.\"Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,\" Latshaw said. \"I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier.\"People we've lost in 2015CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this story.", "ref": "James Best, who played the sheriff on \"the Dukes of Hazzard,\" died Monday at 88.. \"hazzard\" ran from 1979 to 1985 and was among the most popular shows on

I need you to ring me and tell me what's going on \u2026 I need to hear your voice.\"' Mr Johnston served for seven years with Australia's Army Reserves before going travelling and becoming moved by the struggle of ethnic Kurds against IS militants, who have taken control of large parts of Syria of Iraq.His body finally arrived home in Canberra last week, leaving Mrs Johnston to face the grim task of identifying him.She reportedly slapped her son's body when she saw him and then kissed him on the face.According to a family member, his mother would not have supported his choice to fight with the Kurdish people in Syria. Mr Johnston's coffin was draped in the Australian and Kurdistan Democratic Union (PYD) party flags, and was carried by men and women dressed in khaki fatigues and scarves in PYD colours of red, yellow and greenMr Johnston who worked for seven years as part of the Australian Army Reserves is believed to be the first Westerner to die in battle against IS'She wouldn't have supported him fighting there in any shape or form,' a family spokesman told Fairfax Media. 'She doesn't want anyone to go over there, no matter which side they are on.' Sitting with hundreds of mourners, many with pictures of her son and a YPG star pinned to their chests, she listened on Thursday to the story of his legacy.'We came from different lands, different cultures, different religions and different languages' Saadet Ozdemir, a Kurdish community member from Sydney, said.'A young man from Canberra by the name of Ashley Johnston brought our communities together not just in Australia but globally.' Ashley Johnston, originally from Maryborough in Queensland but had most recently been living in Canberra, told his mother Amanda he was simply heading to the Middle East to do humanitarian workMourners at his funeral wore T-shirts imprinted with Mr Johnston's image and carried badges to honour the fallen soldier The service heard Mr Johnston was among eight fighters in a broken-down truck confronted and outnumbered by IS.His comrades said he sacrificed himself to draw enemy fire, a move that saved them.She was joined by over 300 weeping mourners from the Kurdish community, many of whom had never met the 28-year-old Australian army reservist and yet had his picture pinned to their chests alongside the YPG star.

But research with twins suggests picking who to vote for in an election might have more to do with your genes than the policies of the parties.To put this to the test, the Department of Twin Research, which hosts the biggest adult twin registry in the UK, recently performed a poll of voting preferences.Deciding who you will vote for may have more to do with your family than who won the leaders debate (above) finds study which looked at the voting habits of twins born in the UK. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferencesThe twins were all born in the UK and were broadly representative of the UK population. The aim was to explore how much nature and nurture influence our party political allegiances and potential voting preferences so we can draw broader conclusions about people's voting habits.Twins provide a unique natural experiment for research. Identical twins share 100 per cent of their genes, while non-identical twins - like non-twin siblings - share about 50 per cent. Both identical and non-identical twins normally share the same environment while growing up. Twin studies are useful for exploring whether a trait is forged in the genes, passed down or by the environment a person is living in.As identical twins share exactly the same DNA, traits produced by genes should appear in both twins.However in non-identical twins the DNA will not be the same and so differences can occur.In most cases twins should have shared the same environment when growing up too.So by comparing the differences and similarities between identical and non-identical twins it may be possible to unravel whether a trait is environmental or cultural.However, as twins grow up they can be influenced by different groups of friends, cultural experiences and points of view.This can make it difficult to unpick the influence of environment over genetics.In the case of political views, these can also run strongly in families as they tend to share the same socioeconomic background and parents can often impress their political support upon their children.However, the study of twins found identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins. Assuming they had similar upbringings and experiences through adulthood, this would suggest there is an underlying genetic influence for political alignment.By comparing the differences and similarities between them the researchers said they can identify how much of a quirk, disease, or trait is due to a genetic predisposition or environmental and cultural factors. Because twin studies adjust for culture and upbringing, they are an ideal way to study political allegiances.The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins (comprising responses from 612 full pairs) in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leaders.They found that voting Conservative, or not, is strongly influenced by genetics. When it came to voting Tory, they found that 57 per cent of the variability - differences or similarity - between people's voting preferences were due to genetic effects. This percentage is called heritability. That means the identical twins were more likely to vote the same way than the non-identical twins - suggesting an underlying genetic influence was stronger than environmental or random factors.For UKIP voting preferences, there was also a moderately strong heritability of 51 per cent. This was closely followed by Labour and the Green Party both with 48 per cent.The exception seemed to be voting for the Liberal Democrats, which was affected entirely by environment with no genetic influence. Identical twins showed exactly the same level of disparity in preference for the Lib Dems as non-identical twins. Geography also played a possible role - as voting for the SNP in Scotland was also completely environmental.These latest results from UK data confirm the trends found in previous research carried out in the US.The researchers analysed surveys completed by 2,355 twins in March 2015 between the ages of 18 and 80 - most of whom were middle aged. They told the researchers whether they intended to vote, what their political party of choice was, and provided their personal rating of the main party leadersVoting for the Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, pictured above after voting at the last General Election with his wife Samantha, tended to have the strongest heritability according to a study of UK twinsA 2008 survey of 682 pairs of middle-aged twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry showed that self-reported political ideology and right-wing authoritarianism were consistently more similar in the identical twins than fraternal twins.Previous studies have also shown strong genetic influences on right-wing views, be they for or against.'We and others have demonstrated consistent genetic influences on all measurable aspects of our personalities,' said the researchers. 'The consensus is that these political leanings are mainly due to the genetic makeup of our underlying personalities.''Despite this, our survey shows that whether we intend to vote or not does not seem to be influenced by genes and personality. That decision appears to be entirely shaped by environmental factors.'The popularity of Nick Clegg (above), leader of the Liberal Democrats seemed to be heritable, although voting for this party was not heritability and appeared to be influenced by the environment alone, the study showedThe question of whether a leader would make a good prime minister produced mixed responses. David Cameron had the stronger genetic influence on opinions, with 50 per cent heritability, followed by Nick Clegg at 37 per cent. Views on all the other party leaders were purely environmental.Psychology studies have shown our sub-conscious biases for leaders who are tall and with round symmetrical faces so maybe this also plays a role in our choices.But even if we do see party leaders differently, the findings of this study suggest that our choices at the polling booth may not be as free or rational as we would like to believe. Something to think about when you approach the ballot box.Professor Tim Spector is the Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College LondonVictoria Vazquez also contributed to this article.", "ref": "Study of twins in the UK found voting Conservative tends to run in families..

He added that Liverpool were a 'superpower' in world football and didn't have to sell their star assets before saying that Sterling just has to 'concentrate on his football'. Raheem Sterling looks relaxed during Liverpool's training session on Thursday morning despite uncertainty over his future at the club following revelations made in a TV interview Sterling shakes hands with his manager Brendan Rodgers during the Melwood training sessionSterling appeared to give his manager a pat on the back as they talked during training Rodgers issues instructions to Sterling as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's match with Arsenal Sterling's comments in the BBC interview have heightened speculation he will depart Anfield this summerSterling admitted he was 'flattered' by interest from Arsenal as his contract talks are put on holdSterling and Daniel Sturridge share a joke on the training ground during Thursday morning's sessionThe players were in a relaxed mood despite the continued speculation over Sterling's future at the clubThe England international cast doubt on his Liverpool future in an interview with the BBCSterling himself looked relaxed as he trained at Melwood on Thursday morning, sharing a joke with Daniel Sturridge as Rodgers and his staff put the team through its paces ahead of the Premier League trip to the Emirates to face Arsenal. Sterling also shook hands with his manager as the players reconvened after the international break.  And in his press briefing ahead of the Arsenal match, Rodgers said: 'The concentration a few weeks back was to purely focus on his football, and help him continue with his development at the place he's made great strides over last couple of years.'The last time we sat down with the player and his representatives that was the intention.'Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that, and hopefully will continue to focus on his football until the end of the season.'What he said absolutely underpins everything we're trying to achieve here. Raheem says his ambition is to win trophies, and that's perfectly aligned with what we're trying to do.'Rodgers added: 'This is Liverpool, one of the great clubs of the football world. It is an honour for him to play at a club like Liverpool and he understands that.'What he's saying is that he's got two-and-a-half years left; he's quite relaxed as I am, he just wants to concentrate on football. Sterling trains alongside Brazilian Philippe Coutinho as the Liverpool team get ready for Saturday's match'I'm quite relaxed on it. It's part of the modern game. People who look after players have different ways of working. 'The focus is purely on the football. He has been involved with the first team for two-and-a-half years and is the player he is today is because of this environment and what we've created.'He's got a lot of improvement to do and this is the best place for him to do it.'He's not going anywhere in the summer. The focus on trying to make him the best player we can.'When asked whether money talked in situations like this, Rodgers replied: 'This club has shown that's not the case. Liverpool is one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear and we've seen it before that money doesn't come into it. 'If the club doesn't want to sell it won't sell. That's that case with any player, Raheem or anybody else.'It's about continuing to nurture a young player so he can be consistently playing at the top if his game.'For Raheem it's purely about the football and he's made it clear that he's happy here. Trying to put off all the talk. He's a boy who loves his football. He understands and respects the opportunity that he's had.'Still has two-and-a-bit years left of his deal so it's not something we're overly concerned about. Hopefully we'll get it sorted out.'

'He's a young player who has to learn and sometimes they makes mistakes. Our relationship is strong. He will learn as time goes on. We all make mistakes, especially when you're young England international Sterling confessed in the BBC interview that he was 'quite flattered' to be linked with Arsenal and added that he used to dream of playing abroad.Despite turning down the six-figure contract, described by Rodgers a few weeks ago as an 'incredible offer', Sterling insisted he is not a money-grabber.'It's not about the money at all,' Sterling said.'It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about.'I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be.Sterling denied he was a 'money-grabber' in the interview, saying he was only concerned about football'I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old.'I try to kill it off, but I don't think the public can see it that way.'I think they just see it as this 20-year-old boy being greedy.'I just want to take the time to think about what I've achieved in my career so far, where I need to go and what I need to do to get better as a player.'Everyone's dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country. But, in reality, I'm happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies.'Liverpool find themselves five points behind Manchester United in the battle for the top four placesRodgers organises the footballs during Liverpool's Thursday morning training sessionMario Balotelli, who trained wearing a red and white snood, in action at Melwood Lazar Markovic tries to run the ball away from Lucas during a practice match in Thursday's trainingJoe Allen finds himself sandwiched by Mario Balotelli and Sterling during the gameRodgers shakes the hand of Alberto Moreno as Liverpool get ready for their encounter with ArsenalRodgers gives Coutinho a pat on the back as the Reds make their preparations for the trip to ArsenalCaptain Steven Gerrard pings one of his trademark passes in the training session at MelwoodApril 4 Arsenal (A)April 8 Blackburn Rovers (A)FA Cup Sixth Round ReplayApril 13 Newcastle United (H)April 18 Hull City (A)April 25 West Bromwich Albion (A)May 2 Queens Park Rangers (H)May 9 Chelsea (A)May 16 Crystal Palace (H)May 24 Stoke City (A)'If, at that point in time [last season], I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now.'I just think the timing was a bit off.'While Sterling's contract negotiations will now be postponed until the summer at least, Liverpool need to reignite their top four challenge at the Emirates.Their ambitions to qualify for next season's Champions League took a hammer blow when they lost 2-1 at home to Manchester United before the international break, opening up a five-point gap between the two rivals.Rodgers said he had no fresh fitness concerns ahead of the trip to north London.

Durst is pictured here last month in New OrleansAttorney Dick DeGuerin whispered into Durst's ear as he entered the plea. He had to whisper twice before Durst said, 'I am not guilty, your honor.'Judge Franz Zibilich asked if Durst was making that plea to both charges against him. DeGuerin whispered again, and Durst said, 'Yes, your honor.'The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of a longtime friend. Durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison.Durst's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in New Orleans. An affidavit filed there accuses Durst of breaking a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. Prosecutors have asked a U.S. magistrate judge to order Durst to be brought to federal court for a hearing next Thursday \u2014 and that he remain in U.S. custody until the federal matter is resolved.Durst, an estranged member of the family that runs 1 World Trade Center in New York, has had multiple run-ins with the law over his nearly 72 years.He was arrested in New Orleans last month on the eve of the finale of a six-part HBO documentary called 'The Jinx' about Durst, the disappearance of his first wife in 1982, the death of a longtime friend in 2000 and the death and dismemberment of a neighbor in Galveston in 2001.Murdered: Susan Berman, who acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance, was shot in the head at her LA home in 2000, just as the cold case into the disappearance of Kathleen Durst was reopened. Durst was charged with Berman's murder last month A self-defense plea won acquittal in the death of Morris Black, but Durst is charged in Los Angeles with murder in the death of longtime friend Susan Berman, 55, who was shot in the head in 2000. Berman, an author, acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance. The Jinx suggested she knew a lot about Durst. Her death coincided with the cold case of Kathleen Durst's disappearance being reopened. Durst's lawyers, DeGuerin and Billy Gibbens, have said repeatedly that he just wants to go to California to deal with that charge.They also have challenged the weapons charges on several grounds, including the allegation that the FBI 'rummaged' through Durst's belongings before getting an arrest or search warrant.But Andrea Armstrong, a criminal law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans, said Wednesday that 'the fact that it was warrantless doesn't necessarily mean it was unconstitutional.'There are at least 11 circumstances, starting with consent, that make it legal to search without a warrant, she said.DeGuerin also has argued that the two felonies to which Durst pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania \u2014 possessing a firearm while a fugitive and doing so while under indictment \u2014 are not among those that would make it illegal for him to have a gun.Until his indictment Wednesday, Durst had been arrested but not formally charged in connection with the .38-caliber revolver authorities say was found in his room at the J.W. Marriott, where he was staying under the name Everette Ward.According to court testimony, an FBI agent recognized Durst in a New Orleans hotel March 14 and escorted him to his hotel room. Durst was arrested early March 15 on the Los Angeles warrant and arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day.Durst's lawyers say the arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the final episode of 'The Jinx,' which also described the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, in 1982 from New York; the Los Angeles shooting of Berman, 55, in 2000; and Black's death in 2001.", "ref": "Robert Durst was indicted Wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in New Orleans..

Durst, 71, is wanted in California for the murder of his friend Susan Berman.. Berman, an author who formerly acted a media spokeswoman for Durst, was shot in the head at her benedict canyon home in 2000.", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 4.0, "accuracy": 4.0, "coverage":

'But I've decided that now is the time to retire from full-time employment and the end of this year seems a good time to go.'The new building has been completed, so we at last have proper exhibition space, new conservation and scientific facilities, and first-class accommodation for our growing research activities.

We respect his decision to move on, and want to support him in his new projects.'We are now starting the process of looking for someone to take on what will be one of the best and most challenging jobs of its kind in the world. 'The museum is in great shape, and we are fortunate to have an outstanding team in place to lead its activities and help build its future with the new director.'The collection of the British Museum is in a real sense the memory of mankind and the task is to present it in the best possible way in and beyond Bloomsbury for the benefit of present and future generations.'The museum, in Bloomsbury, central London, received 6.7 million visitors in 2014/15 and recent exhibitions have looked at life in China, Afghanistan, and ancient Rome.", "ref": "Neil macgregor to leave job he has held since 2002 at the end Of the year..

Poor standards in many care homes and reduced home help could also prompt early deaths, experts say.The deterioration follows three decades in which annual average life expectancy has increased by 1.2 per cent for men aged 65 and 0.7 per cent for women.The study by Public Health England said it was too early to say whether the change was a long-term one.Professor John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said: 'One of the issues we have seen is women living lifestyle's becoming more like those of men over recent decades, with more smoking and drinking.'Scroll down for video He also suggested the falls could reflect cutbacks in social care, which he said had been 'hammered' in recent years.Recent governments had failed to invest in care for an ageing population, Professor Ashton said, leaving insufficient help for the frail and vulnerable.He added: 'There has been a failure of successive governments in that we should have seen that trends were changing, that more people would be living longer and we needed to put services in place to look after them.'We are letting down a generation which came back from the war and built the welfare state.'By 2013, the average 75-year-old woman could expect to live another 13 years and five weeks \u2013 five weeks less than in 2011, a Government report showsPublic Health England said the fall among women aged 65 was the first since 1995, while that among those aged 75 had not been seen for nine years. It called the falls statistically significant.Since then, the figures for women in their sixties have recovered to their 2011 level, but the 2013 statistics for older women remained worse than those two years earlier.It means average life expectancy for a women of 85 is now two and a half months shorter than in 2011. Health officials need a third year's data to establish whether the figures from 2012 and 2013 mean life expectancy is levelling off or entering a more worrying decline.The report said: 'Within England, although female life expectancy at all four ages fell in 2012, and for males it fell at ages 85 and 95 and remained static at ages 65 and 75, it is too early to say whether this represents a slowing in the upward trend or the start of a downward trend.'Public Health England said the impact of the recession could be one reason why life expectancy fell in several European countries. Flu outbreaks and cold winters may also be to blame.Caroline Abrahams, of the charity Age UK, said: 'This decrease in life expectancy, after many years of improvement, is like the canary in the coal mine. It is telling us that something has changed for the worse, so that fewer people are thriving in later life than they could or should.'The most likely culprit is the rapid decline of state-funded social care in recent years, which is leaving hundreds of thousands of older people to struggle on alone at home without any help.'This decrease in life expectancy, after many years of improvement, is like the canary in the coal mine''More and more older people are living with several incurable conditions and illnesses. Determined action now to sustain social care and to support older people with multiple long-term health conditions more effectively can hopefully make this a blip, rather than the start of a terrible trend.'Despite the new figures, a 65-year-old man in the UK can expect to live 18 years and six months \u2013 still almost five and a half more years than 30 years ago. A woman of the same age can expect 21 more years \u2013 a gain of almost four years in the last three decades.Men of 75 can now expect to live 11 years and 15 weeks, with 13 years five weeks for women, while at 85, men can expect five years and 42 weeks, and women six years and 42 weeks.", "ref": "Predicted life spans of women aged 65, 75, 85 and 95 fell in 2012.. Also found increasing life expectancy for men in 60s and 70s had stalled..

The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of \u00a312million, signing a four-and-a-half year contract.The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches.Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in the January transfer windowAnd it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season, but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy.'This Shaqiri thing is completely made up,' he told reporters.'We bought Shaqiri last January because we think that he can have a big future at Inter. Then during the season, there might be a moment when a player's form drops, and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in. So that's the only situation going on right now.'Shaqiri has our full confidence. He is our player. Then he has also changed his team, so it's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage.Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches'It's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself.'He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason. So one only plays when he deserves to play. 'We bought Shaqiri because we believe in his qualities,' Mancini added.The Inter boss insists Shaqiri will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary'Then if Bayern [Munich] decided to sell him, it's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play.'Inter could be the right solution for him and we are happy about this. I am sure that Shaqiri next season will achieve great things.'", "ref": "Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in January this year..

By using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock (shown). He said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes. And the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarceDr Paolo Bombelli will present his research as part of the Pint of Science festival, which is running from 18 to 20 May in 50 cities across nine countries.His idea is relatively simple - by wiring up plants to an electro-chemical system, he is able to harness the waste electrons and energy produced during the photosynthesis process.And the results are surprisingly efficient. He demonstrated how a smartphone-sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock. The Pint of Science festival is taking place from Monday 18 to Wednesday 20 May 2015.It sees scientists of various disciplines give talks in pubs around the world, with topics ranging from the brain to space, that the public can attend for \u00a33 - the 'price of a pint'.Dr Paolo Bombelli, with his moss-powered clock, is one of the scientists taking part.This year more than 600 science evenings will take place in 50 cities across nine countries.Cities in the UK include Bristol, London, Manchester and Southampton.A full schedule can be found on their website.An A4-sized area of leaves - about 93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day.Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the movie The Matrix.'In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,' he explained.'And although it was a bit crude, the concept is actually correct.'But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans.'The apparatus required is also relatively simple - cables, some water and a plant.At the moment, Dr Bombelli is trying to find a way to increase the 'flux' of electrons emitted by a plant, making more energy available.'If we can crack this, we can get a very large flux of electrons coming out, then we can build a biological solar panel,' he told MailOnline.Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the 1999 movie The Matrix. 'In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,' he explained, shown in this image from the movie. 'But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans'An A4-sized area of leaves - about (93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. The ultimate goal is to develop panels that generate five watts per square metre (11 square ft). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metreDr Paolo Bombelli  presented his research at a preview  of the Pint of Science festival (left). He is adamant that regular moss (stock image right) could provide an additional source of renewable energy to complement others that are availableFor example, he said people could have one of these panels on the roof of their house to power certain appliances in their home. The goal is to generate up to five watts per square metre (11 square feet).By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre. The uses are not just in the home, though. Dr Bombelli said in regions where people don't have access to energy, biological solar panels could be useful for tasks such as growing crops.People could be shown how to build the simple systems and, unlike solar panels which require technical expertise to fix, the biological solar panels can be fixed easily. 'To assemble one is not too difficult,' he explained.And to demonstrate just how useful the technology can be, Dr Bombelli is gearing up to deploy a plant-powered system in London Zoo.A trap camera powered by moss will be installed in the next four to eight weeks, and ultimately the same camera could be used to capture images of animals in the wild.Rice farming is one area Dr Bombelli sees his technology being useful. It could help power technology in areas where electricity is scarce, possibly increasing yields. Shown is a stock image of rice paddy fields in India, one region Dr Bombelli said his technology could be usefulHe noted that there are limitations: the technology is not very mobile, and its power output is low compared to other renewable energies.Nonetheless he thinks it could be part of a 'portfolio of renewable technology' to generate electricity.'We don't really think the world is going to be powered by this technology, but it could play a role,' he said.", "ref": "University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy..

However, his car has now been found safe and sound by Adam Coppin from Salford, who read of Mr Matthews's plight and decided to use his day off to help.Mr Coppin, 32, spent this morning searching for Mr Matthews's car and found it safe and sound in an office car park in Salford Quays.'I've been in similar situations parking at work, then forgetting what floor of the multi-storey I've parked on and walking around for ages,' said Mr Coppin, who works as a technical advisor at MediaCityUK. 'I could imagine his frustration, especially after running a marathon.'I read the story on Monday night and had an idea from the description where it might be.'As I had today off, I decided to go out and look for it and managed to find it.'There is no damage apart from a few blossoms falling down on it from the tree above. I'm glad I could help.'Mr Matthews left his black Saab 93, similar to this model, in a side street close to Manchester United's Old Trafford ground before the raceMr Matthews, a delivery driver for a builders' merchants, said he could remember driving into Manchester up Princess Parkway and then onto the Mancunian Way, before taking the A56 towards Trafford on his way to the race.He then remembers driving past Old Trafford on his left before parking up in a car park on a side street near a small office block.Mr Matthews, who was competing in the Manchester Marathon for the first time, said: 'The area looked like a small estate and there were chaps with high vis vests waving people in.'I did the race then walked back past Old Trafford and looked around for about an hour.'I actually ended up walking part of the course again.'Then I spent about 40 minutes in a taxi and we looked all around near the Imperial War Museum but couldn't find it.Mr Matthews had searched this area of Manchester during the hunt for his missing car'I went to the police station and there was another chap and a lady there in exactly the same position.'Mr Matthews, who has competed in nine other marathons, added: 'I was that worn out, I was just anxious and annoyed.Manchester council had told him there was no record of the vehicle, which had a silver bike rack attached to it, being towed or impounded.Grateful Mr Matthews said he was so relieved to be reunited with the vehicle that he wants to make a donation to a charity of Mr Coppin's choice in order to say thank you.He plans to travel to Manchester tomorrow to retrieve his vehicle. 'I am so relieved, it's a massive burden lifted off me,' he said.'I'm so glad I don't have to go out looking for it again or buy a new car. I am so grateful to this chap for finding it for me.'Once I've got it back I'd like to make a donation to a charity of his choice to say thank you for his troubles.'", "ref": "Jason Matthews, 40, parked in side street before Manchester Marathon..

Nicole, a 30-year-old woman, doesn't have to imagine this scenario because it's her everyday reality.  The small and unusual living space is all that this employed, single mother can afford in her high-cost community in San Mateo, California.Nicole isn't alone in her struggles.CNN recently published a powerful piece called \"Poor kids of Silicon Valley\" that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the Bay Area.  One aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people, including 11 children.  Another chronicles a husband and wife named Rich and Stacey, both of whom have jobs, who are living in a San Jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they don't have the money to go anywhere else.Although Silicon Valley has unique characteristics, it isn't the only community confronting these challenges.  Our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis.  The agency I lead, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low-income households live in substandard housing, spend more than half their incomes on rent or both.These are families who are dedicating $1 out of every $2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head.  And the more they spend on housing, the less they have to invest in their children's education, build up savings and shop at local businesses.  These are outcomes that hurt our nation's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action.HUD is working with local partners across the country to do just that.First, we're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists. Since the mid-1970s, we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units.  But by 2020, we're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing, ending agreements to control rents in these units.  So we've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come.We're also doing the same with public housing. Right now, the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year, mainly because of disrepair, HUD created the Rental Assistance Demonstration  initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good.It's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as Lexington, North Carolina, where the local housing authority is making 58 years' worth of repairs in just 22 months, including new lighting, modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs.RAD has allowed local communities to raise more than $733 million in new capital to date. That's why we're asking Congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program. No American should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home.In addition to preservation, HUD is also working to create new affordable housing.  A Harvard study revealed that in 2012, there were 11.5 million extremely low-income households and only 3.3 million affordable units available.  It's clear that we can't preserve our way out of this problem.  We've got to grow the supply to meet demand, so HUD is taking a multifaceted approach.For example, our HOME Investment Partnerships Program is leveraging $4 in private and other public resources for every $1 in HOME funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families.This is more than just a statistic: It is progress for people, from the families living in the Broadway Crossing development in Washington to the seniors living in the Woodcrest Retirement Residence in Pennsylvania.  To keep this momentum going, we've asked Congress to increase HOME funding by 16% to keep building affordable homes, prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation.We are also asking Congress to expand our Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients of modest means, the elderly, and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market.  This includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration.And we're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact.For instance, HUD awarded $94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the San Francisco Bay Area, including Silicon Valley, in January.  And we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment. To empower communities, President Barack Obama has also requested $300 million for new Local Housing Policy Grants to help them increase housing affordability, economic growth and access to jobs. All of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast-to-coast.Our nation's affordable housing challenges won't be solved overnight, and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper. Let's not squander this chance to make real progress for American families. Incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good.By leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state, local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners, I know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all.", "ref": "Cnn's john sutter told the story of the \"poor kids of Silicon Valley\" hud

The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decadeDespite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year.Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward.Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding.But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe.Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home.Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed.Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hidingScott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custodyMr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.'Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said.It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors.Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin.", "ref": "Scott Kelley, now 50, and Mary Nunes, now 19, went missing in fall 2004..

The demand is increasing exponentially as the word spreads.\"While Farrarons and Basford are based in the UK, the concept is taking off in the U.S. too, with the publication of titles like Virginia-based art therapist Lacy Mucklow and illustrator Angela Porter's \"Color Me Calm\" and \"Color Me Happy,\" created for the minds and motor skills of Mom and Dad, not the kids.The trend doesn't seem to be letting up. Basford is working on a third title, Farrarons has been commissioned for a second book, and Mucklow and Porter will release \"Color Me Stress-Free\" in September.Adults have long used crafts to unwind, but why coloring books? Why now? It may have something to do with online access -- and, funnily enough, the desire to unplug.Ordering a coloring book that suits adult tastes online is easier than walking into a bookstore where the only options have Barbie or Thomas the Tank Engine themes. Plus, everyone's favorite online crafting hub, Pinterest, is a treasure trove of adult coloring pages, with themes ranging from nature and animals to classic paintings.Meanwhile, like children, adults need a break from screen time -- and many are rediscovering the analog pleasures of coloring inside the lines.\"I'm a grown-up, but I still love coloring books,\" novelist Matt Cain proclaimed in a piece for The Guardian.\"If I switch off the phone, computer and TV and concentrate solely on choosing the right shade of blue, avoiding going over the lines and slowly filling up my page with colour, all my other concerns, I've discovered, fade to nothing,\" Cain wrote.The therapeutic benefits of art are nothing new; it's a concept that practitioners use with patients of all ages.Atlanta-based art therapist Susanne Fincher, who has published several coloring books, said coloring can lift the mood, reduce anxiety and relieve stress.\"Art making is a powerful intervention,\" Fincher wrote in an email. \"Neuroscientific research has shown that through the use of art therapy, the human brain can physically change, grow, and rejuvenate.\"True art therapy, she warned, should be administered only by a qualified professional.Mindfulness and meditative coloring are recurring themes in the growing adult coloring book industry. A search for \"adult coloring books\" on Amazon or Barnes and Noble will yield several books of mandalas, a ritual symbol in Buddhism and Hinduism that represents the universe, waiting to be colored in.\"I sometimes give clients one of my mandala coloring books for homework between sessions with me,\" Fincher wrote. \"Coloring mandalas can empower a client to manage thoughts and feelings on their own with the positive activity of coloring, instead of, for example, overeating or abusing substances.\"The opportunity to craft a mindfulness coloring book for adults was serendipitous for illustrator Farrarons, who had been practicing mindfulness for a few years before getting the offer to create a book.\"In mindfulness, it is encouraged to break patterns in life by introducing variation to avoid the sensation of being on autopilot,\" Farrarons wrote in an email while on holiday in Korea. \"Each page has been caringly designed with this in mind, so that the person coloring can hop at random from one pattern to the next. \"Coloring books like Farrarons' pocket-sized volume bring a bit of calming and spirituality to the masses, but for some adult enthusiasts coloring is just a fun throwback to a simpler time, she added.\"It reminds me of hours spent filling in scenes from a coloring book as a little girl. In the digital age that we are in, surely, it can only be a good thing to pick up a pencil and feel young again.\"", "ref": "Coloring books made for adults are popular on Amazon's bestselling books list..

When they are finally put on sale, only a few will be sold at the listed price. The impasse has left fans in the dark, and ticket brokers perplexed.Floyd Mayweather performs at a media workout with his uncle Roger on the pads in Las Vegas Manny Pacquiao was in good spirits as he showed off his skills for the fans earlier this week'It's bizarre, normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight,' said Connor Gregoire, an analyst for Seatgeek.com. 'To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.'Mayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said Tuesday that tickets would go on sale this week for the May 2 fight, but MGM officials have been tight-lipped about their availability. The hotel issued a statement Friday saying there would be a 'limited number of tickets available for sale' and that it is working with promoters to finalize a date for their release.The fight was always going to be a tough ticket, with announced prices of \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena. But those prices have already tripled in the resale market even before tickets are available, and the two camps and the MGM have been bickering over how many seats - and at what price level - each party gets.Pacquiao's manager, Michael Koncz, blamed the Mayweather camp for holding up the ticket sales, saying they have refused to sign a term sheet negotiated months earlier that specified the allotments.'It's a real mess right now,' Koncz said. 'I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the holdup? I'm more than a little upset they're not for sale to the public.'Millions of dollars are at stake in the dispute, because after the MGM takes its share each camp gets a certain percentage of tickets and is able to resell them with ticket brokers for higher prices. The estimated gate for the tickets if they are sold at retail prices is already a staggering \u00a348million, far surpassing the previous gate record of \u00a313.3million for Mayweather's 2013 fight with Canelo Alvarez.Pacquiao used Instagram to show his fans a photo of his ripped body as he continues his preparationPromoter Bob Arum said he has heard of people cancelling their reservations to Las Vegas because they're afraid they can't get tickets.'This is not acceptable,' said Arum, who promotes Pacquiao. 'This is a worldwide event that the city of Las Vegas is involved in. It's one of the craziest things I've ever seen.'Gregoire said the fight is one of Seatgeek's most searched events, but that only a few dozen tickets have been sold through the website. Those tickets are what the ticket industry calls 'spec tickets' because the sellers don't actually have them in hand, but expect to get them before the fight.The Filipino fighter is looking to put an end to Mayweather's current unbeaten record in the ringThe cheapest seat on the site on Friday was \u00a33,200, and Gregoire said the average sale so far is in the \u00a35,300 range.'People are hesitant to buy in the secondary market before there's been an original sale,' he said. 'And you've also got the incredible prices being asked for tickets now. That means a lot of people are not buying tickets at this point.'At Stubhub there are no tickets for sale, spokeswoman Alison Salcedo said, because the ticket reseller is waiting for actual prices to be set and tickets to be printed.Music artist Liljamez posted the photo of 'Money' with just over two weeks to go until the bout'There's still so much up in the air for this fight that we're not allowing spec sales,' Salcedo said. 'We're not willing to take that risk now.'Tickets have also not gone on sale for the closed circuit telecast of the fight at the various MGM properties in Las Vegas. Thousands of those tickets are expected to be sold to fans that can't get into the arena itself, but no price has been set for them.Pacquiao shows off his impressive speed - which he will hope will trouble MayweatherEarning an estimated $180million from the bout, Mayweather is confident he won't lose his perfect recordKoncz said he talked to Pacquiao on Thursday about making sure he had enough tickets to take care of people in his camp. He said there have been requests from around the world for fight tickets, but that they have been forced to put them off because of the uncertainty over how many tickets are available and their pricing.One thing that is certain, he said, is no one - including the celebrities who generally populate the ringside seats - is getting in for free.'Nobody's getting free tickets,' Koncz said. 'Even Bob (Arum) has to pay for his ticket in the first row.'Mayweather and Pacquiao pose during a press conference ahead of their mega-fight in Las Vegas", "ref": "Fans are in the dark ahead of Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao fight..

Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country.As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat?This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma.First, the back story:One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism.A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a \"genocide.\" (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides.For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question.John Paul II used the \"g\" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together.Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings \"a great evil\" and \"terrible persecution\" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.)As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word \"genocide.\"He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document.\"In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,\" Francis said. \"The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people.\"The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul.In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins.\"The Vatican and the papacy love continuity,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter.If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said.At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday.\"The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it,\" Reese said of the Armenian murders. \"He's telling people: There's nothing new here.\"New or not, Turkey was not happy.The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for \"consultations\" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported.In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word \"unacceptable\" and \"out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis.\"\"Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,\" the tweet reads.\"Hatred\" and \"animosity\" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis.Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different.He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.)But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the \"Mexicanization\" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch.On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his \"genocide\" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had.\"We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard,\" Francis said.CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.", "ref": "Previous popes had finessed the question of whether the killing of 1.5 million Armenians was genocide..

The sentence sparked outrage from his supporters, including the school itself and the international community, who insist he is innocent and expressed concern over the rule of law in Indonesia.Scroll down for video Last embrace: Canadian teacher Neil Bantleman kisses his wife Tracy before being sentenced to ten years in prison for sexually abusing three young children at a prestigious international school in Indonesia todayIn a packed courtroom, the administrator was convicted of abusing three young boys at the Jakarta Intercultural School, which has for decades been favoured by expatriates and wealthy Indonesians.Also standing trial for abusing the children is Ferdinand Tjiong, an Indonesian teaching assistant at the school. A verdict on his case was to be handed down later today. Both men, who have strongly denied committing abuse, received backing from the school, parents, and the international community.Their supporters have said the case is deeply flawed and motivated by a bid by one alleged victim's family to get compensation from the school. Before the trial: The couple were pictured hugging before Mr Bantleman was handed the devastating verdict in Jakarta todayBehind bars: Tracy Bantleman looked on in misery as her husband of two years languished behind bars while awaiting his trialFollowing the verdict, Canada and Britain called for the authorities to follow due legal process, while America said it was 'deeply disappointed' and warned it could damage Indonesia's reputation.After nine hours reading the verdict at South Jakarta District Court, presiding judge Nur Aslam said that Bantleman was guilty of abusing the children.'The defendant did not admit his crime or express regret for his deeds, nor did he apologise for what he did, which psychologically damaged underage children,' she said.He was sentenced to ten years in jail and ordered to pay a fine of 100 million rupiah (\u00a35,200).Prosecutors had sought a 12-year term.To applause and cheers from his supporters, who included many parents at the school, Bantleman said that he would appeal the verdict: 'We will continue to fight until the truth comes out.'Her voice breaking with emotion, his wife Tracy Bantleman said that she was 'deeply disturbed and appalled by the decision of the panel of judges. Devastating news: Mr Bantleman looked up in dismay as his guilty verdict was read out by the judgeShock: A stunned Tracy Bantleman, pictured moments after her husband's guilty verdict was read outLed away: The teacher, who also holds British nationality, was found guilty of abusing boys at the Jakarta Intercultural School Intercultural School, sparking anger among supporters who insist he is innocent'They have absolutely, utterly ignored evidence in support of my husband'. The scandal, which erupted in April last year with accusations of abuse levelled at cleaning staff, has sparked deep unease among Jakarta's expatriate community and foreign governments alike.U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, Robert Blake, said there were serious questions about 'the investigative process and lack of credible evidence against the teachers'.'We are deeply disappointed with this outcome... the broad international community is following this case closely. 'The outcome of the legal process and what it reveals about the rule of law in Indonesia will have a significant impact on Indonesia's reputation abroad.'The British Embassy in Jakarta said in a statement there were 'concerns about irregularities in this case'.Hefty sentence: The ten-year jail term has sparked outrage from Mr Bantleman's supporters, including the school itself and the international communityEmotional goodbye: Tracy Bantleman hugs her husband as he is led away from court after being sentencedInternational disapproval: The British Embassy in Jakarta said in a statement there were 'concerns about irregularities in this case'Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson said that Canada had 'called for a fair and transparent trial throughout the judicial process'.Accusations of assault at the school - formerly known as the Jakarta International School - initially sparked horror among the expatriate community.But the focus soon shifted to what supporters say was an unfair attempt to target Bantleman and Tjiong by Indonesia's notoriously corrupt police and judicial system.Supporters have accused police of a botched investigation, and point to unfair trials, which the judge closed to the public as they involved children. The court was open to the public for the reading of the verdicts.The prosecution insists that the testimony of the alleged victims, all boys, is the truth and that their claims are backed up by evidence from medical examinations.However, the defence argues the medical exams were flawed.The men have said the decision to prosecute them revolved around a separate lawsuit filed by the family of one of the alleged victims, which demands $125million in compensation from the school.Happier times: Neil and Tracy Bantleman, pictured at a wedding in Scotland in July 2013, are staying together despite allegations he has abused a young boy at the Jakarta school where they both workStaying together: Neil and Tracy Bantleman, pictured here attending a friend's wedding in Bali, Indonesia", "ref": "Neil Bantleman, also a British national, found guilty of abusing three boys..

In many ways that's the driving force for us but we've still got an awful lot to do.'It's more congested (at the bottom of the table) but because of the gap there has been for such a long time we don't have any chances of getting away with a disappointing result.Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso opened the scoring against West Ham with a spectacular effort last SaturdayHowever the Foxes were instantly punished when West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate netted immediatelyBut Andy King (left) was the hero as the Premier League strugglers struck late on at the King Power Stadium'We've got to try and force the issue between now and the end of the season.'Leicester have been rooted to the foot of the table since November but are slowly building much-needed momentum as the battle to avoid the drop intensifies.'I hope (we've got momentum). Back-to-back wins are difficult to achieve, especially for a side like ourselves who have been struggling for vast parts of the season in terms of results,' he said.'It's going to be tough but we'll give it a good shot.'Leicester have a relatively manageable run-in and play host to Swansea City in their next game on Saturday.", "ref": "Leicester looked to be on the brink of relegation just two weeks ago..

'These are wild animals.'They're also not fit to be kept as pets.Though small pups are cute they can be very dangerous, officials warned'The animal needs fluids, needs special treatments,' he said. 'You can't just feed it dog food.

Instead, it's their puppet likenesses - commissioned for ITV's new comedy spoof show, Newzoids.And the Duke and Duchess aren't the only royals to get a puppet makeover. Their dolls will be joined by an even more amusing version of Prince Harry, as well as a roster of celebrities.Scroll down for video Plastic princess: The Duchess of Cambridge is about to make her debut in puppet formThe show, which has been likened to 1980s behemoth Spitting Image, starts later this month and, according to makers Citrus TV, will offer a similarly light-hearted take on current affairs.Sketches set to feature in the opening show include one that sees David Cameron slug it out with Nick Clegg on a puppet version of The Jeremy Kyle Show.Another sketch will see Ed Miliband's effigy join Ant and Dec to star in a show called 'I'm a Catastrophe... Get Me Out of Here' while a third will see Professor Brian Cox unearthing a new planet - on Kim Kardashian's backside.The six-part series will also feature Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles and The Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry.Star of the show: Prince William's puppet is ready for the launch of new series, NewzoidsThe real thing: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Stephen Lawrence Centre in south LondonRoyal stars: The Duke and Duchess will appear alongside Prince Charles and the Duchess of CornwallThe new show represents the first time that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have found themselves lampooned in a comedy show.But while it will all be new to William and Kate, other members of the Royal Family will remember their starring roles in Spitting Image.Among the most memorable was the jug-eared puppet of Prince Charles, who was famously shown talking on a telephone made of roses.Charles will return to puppet form in Newzoids, this time reimagined as a version of Gogglebox's Dominic Parker.The Duchess of Cornwall will be shown as a take on Steph, with the royal couple set to chortle and booze their way through a Gogglebox-style sketch. Entertainer: Prince Harry will also feature in the ITV show - albeit in puppet formThe Great British Fake Off: Stars Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry also feature in NewzoidsSpeaking about the new show, Elaine Bedell, Director of Entertainment and Comedy for ITV, said: 'ITV has a rich history of playing popular satirical comedy in peaktime on its main channel, and it seemed a good time to revive it this year. 'We are pleased to be adding to our growing comedy portfolio with this funny and biting look at the world of politics and celebrity.'The show, which will be filmed by animation specialists Factory, will be voiced by a cast that includes impressionist Debra Stephenson and will be produced by Giles Pilbrow and Dominic Brigstocke who boast Have I Got News For You and Alan Partridge among their credits.", "ref": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Have been turned into puppets..

{"i": "1269ac399cdcaa0c722df21fa09eae46992ad93b", "src": "A controversial anti-vaccination organisation has come under fire for comparing compulsory vaccination to rape in a social media post.The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network, an anti-vaccinations lobby group, posted an image to their Facebook page on Thursday which shows a man holding a woman with his hand over her mouth in an aggressive silencing gesture.The tag line on the image read, 'Forced penetration. Really- no big deal, if it's just a vaccination needle and he's a doctor. Do you really \"need\" control over over your own choices?'.The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has come under fire for comparing vaccinations to rapeThe image was posted in response to tough new laws announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April, which means that parents will no longer be able to access childcare benefits simply by signing a form that says they object to immunisation based on 'personal, philosophical or religious' reasons.However, a president of the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network said the message had nothing to do with the group. 'I can state categorically that The Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network Inc does not support or agree with the sentiments or messages portrayed in the picture,' she said.'We do not own the page it was posted on.' 'What the Australian Vaccination-skeptics Network does support and believe in, is the right of ALL parents to make an informed choice in regards to vaccinating their children, whether they vaccinate, selectively vaccinate or do not vaccinate at all,' she said.'We are pro-choice, pro-information and pro-parental rights. The new federal law, which was in part prompted by the death of one-month-old Riley Hughes from complications arising from whooping cough, means that parents who refuse to immunise their children are set to lose up to $15,000 a year for every child when the changes come into force from January 1, 2016.The post, which has since been removed, caused an instant outcry from followers and opponents of the group alike, with social media users labelling the post 'tasteless', 'disgusting', and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assault.'Dear rape victims, according to the rabid anti-vaxxers what you went thru is no worse than. Shame,' said one social media user.'Are you saying that your child being immunised is as bad as your child being raped? This could also be very triggering for victims of sexual assault,' said another. The administrator of the page defended the post, maintaining that is wasn't tasteless, but honest. 'What truly is tasteless is our elected government trying to tell us that we have to vaccinate our children even if we don't believe it is best for their health,' the administrator wrote. 'That is tasteless. And if you find this post confronting \u2013 imagine how you would feel if you were a parent who was being told that they were going to have to vaccinate their children or starve.'Fiona McCormack, the CEO of Domestic Violence Victoria said the comparison was 'so irresponsible and inappropriate'. Social media users labelling the post 'tasteless', 'disgusting', and a possible trigger for those who had suffered sexual assaultThe image was posted in response to tough new 'no jab, no pay' laws which was announced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison earlier in April'To compare a doctor injecting a child against something like the measles to rape \u2026 it's obscene,' Ms McCormack told The Age. On Wednesday, a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisation.'As written in the about section, the AVN has not owned this Facebook page for some time. This page is open to the public. We sincerely apologise for an earlier post that caused offense to many, including supporters. We are still investigating and have taken your comments on board,' the post said.  The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations, when reports of a child being given a court order to be immunised was labelled by the group as 'court ordered rape'.'Think this is an exaggeration? Think again. This is assault without consent and with full penetration too,' the post said. 'If you were the doctor ordered to administer this vaccine and the mother was standing there, holding her child under a court order while you prepared the shot and she was begging you to stop and crying that it would hurt and you continued to do it anyway - how different is that from rape?' the administrator later commented on the post.The Network has previously come under fire when it was stripped of its registered charity status last year. The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has previously used the metaphor of rape to oppose vaccinations'Think this is an exaggeration? Think again. This is assault without consent and with full penetration too,' the post saidNew South Wales Fair Trading Minister Stuart Ayres demanded that the group surrender i''ts authority to fundraise, which it has done, under the Charitable Fundraising Act,' he said.'An investigation has highlighted a number of potential concerns,' he told The ABC.Mr Ayres said that the NSW Government had been collecting information as to the accuracy of facts provided by the group about the dangers of immunisation.'We will continue to monitor the information that they put on their website. We will continue to ensure that they present themselves as an anti-vaccination advocacy. That's entirely up to them to do that. We want to make sure that they don't ever promote misleading information.' The Health Care Complaints Commission released a statement in relation to the AVN last year, which contained a warning for members of the public when considering the information the lobby group posted on their website.'AVN does not provide reliable information in relation to certain vaccines and vaccination more generally,' the statement said. 'The Commission considers that AVN's dissemination of misleading, misrepresented and incorrect information about vaccination engenders fear and alarm and is likely to detrimentally affect the clinical management or care of its readers.'  The tough new vaccination law was in part prompted by the death of one-month-old Riley Hughes from complications arising from whooping cough On Wednesday, a post to the page said that the controversial post was made by someone independent to the organisationIn December 2012, the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading ordered the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN)- which Ms Dorey was then president of - to change its name or risk being shut down.The move followed 'numerous' complaints from both the public and the Australian Medical Association that the AVN name was misleading the public and wasn't an accurate representation of its activities.The AVN claims to be pro-choice and a 'vaccine safety watchdog'However, t-shirts on the group's website seemed to promote more fierce objectives which rule out vaccinating children at all. One top featured the slogan: 'Love Them, Protect Them, Never Inject Them'.", "ref": "A statement claiming to be from an anti-vaccination lobby group has compared immunisation to rape ..

It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles.The debt of a divorced retiree averages \u00a322,100, Prudential's report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers.Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that \u00a39,500 \u2013 the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday's report said.The impact of divorce on a former spouse's wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working.The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up.Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggestsThe latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce \u2013 usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse \u2013 does not fade away even as old age approaches.Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through 'pension-splitting' arrangements.One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to researchPrudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: 'Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement.'A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made.'During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people's lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.'The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.", "ref": "People who have never been divorced can expect an extra \u00a32,100 a year..

On Wednesday, Mel posted a blog post on her website titled 'Are we embarrassed of IVF?' where she detailed how she was undergoing the treatment, and that it was nothing for women to be ashamed of.In her post, Mel wrote: 'In the past few months I joined a new club... It's the IVF Baby Club.' She also uploaded photographs of injecting herself for the first time as she began her IVF program.Mel Greig spoke on her blog about how she was now starting IVF treatment She posted photographs that showed her injecting herself for the first time as she began her IVF programThe radio host married her fianc\u00e9 Steven Pollack at Byron Bay in NovemberThe 33-year-old married her fianc\u00e9 Steven Pollack at Byron Bay in a small and intimate ceremony on November 20. But the couple's efforts to have a baby have been thwarted because she suffers from Endometriosis. Endometriosis causes inflammation and can lead to female reproductive body parts and other organs fusing together, making it almost impossible for eggs to fertilise naturally, rendering many women infertile. Mel was one of these women, and had been told she would not be able to fall pregnant naturally. It was then that she made the decision to have IVF treatment. Since then however, she has discovered that some women keep their IVF treatment a secret and are embarrassed about it. For this reason she took to her blog to highlight the issue. Mel showed her support for women who were also going through IVF treatmentThe couple's efforts to have a baby had been unsuccessful because she suffers from Endometriosis'When you are first told that news, you do feel like you've failed the process of being able to bring a child into the world as a \"normal\" mother,' she explained on her blog.'But my thoughts soon shifted to \"but I still have a chance to bring a child into this world and that's amazing\" we should NOT feel embarrassed to have IVF babies.'Before Mel started her own treatment she said she understood why the majority of mothers wanted to keep quiet during the process of IVF as it was long, draining, intrusive, emotional, and for some parents, financially hard.'But when you are through the battle and are holding your precious baby, you should be happy and proud... don't feel embarrassed to say \"they were born through IVF\" you need to realise that science helped you with the end result,' she said on her blog.The 33-year-old went public about it as she wanted to help remove the stigma that women can feel about having IVF treatmentShe hit the headlines in December 2012 for her involvement in an infamous royal prank callWith fellow DJ, Michael Christian (right), they posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in  a phone prank that ended in tragedy 'But it was YOU who decided to bring that child into this world, it was YOU (and partner/donor) who provided the magical ingredients to make your baby. 'And it is YOU who is going to smother this child with unconditional love and support for the rest of their life and THAT is what truly makes you a \"normal\" mother.'Mel has had to overcome challenges in her life before. In December 2012 she was hosting on 2 Day FM with fellow DJ Michael Christian when they posed as the Queen and Prince Charles, and rang the London hospital where the real life Duchess of Cambridge was suffering severe morning sickness with her first child.Nurse Jacintha Saldanha who answered the phone and put the call through to the ward took her own life two days later and cited the distress at being fooled as one of the reasons.The pair's call was answered by nurse Jacintha Saldanha who later committed suicide. She cited the stress caused by the prank as one of the reasons why she took her own life  However, after coming to terms with the tragedy and fallout from it, Mel is ready to take on the next challenge that life has thrown at her - the daunting prospect of IVF treatment.   'As I sit here loading up my first syringe I'm thinking, \"I hope I do this right. If my doctor doesn't answer which friend can I call to ask for advice?\" Women help each other, it's what we do,' she blogged.'But how can we do that if we don't know who to ask for help? Support networks are so important. I will share as much of this journey as I can, through the pain, heartache, joy... and I hope I don't feel the need to keep it private too.Mel has had great support from her husband Steven (right) as she starts her IVF program  'If you are a part of this elite club and you know someone going through IVF, maybe take that first step and privately reach out letting them know you too have membership and you are there for them if they need someone.'I know that I'll be doing the same.'", "ref": "Australian radio host stands up for Women going through IVF treatment..

The Daily Mail has repeatedly called for improved standards under its Dignity for the Elderly campaign.The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013.Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people.During a trial at Peterborough Magistrates Court earlier this year, co-worker Lanya Edwards described how the women, all from Peterborough, abused one resident with 'quite advanced' dementia.Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire (pictured) has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly peopleThe four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013 and told one elderly resident that she was working in a brothel'She would ask where she was a lot. I would say she was in a care home in Peterborough and she would be staying here until she got better,' she said.'But I heard some care assistants tell her she was living in a brothel. She used to get quite worried. It is not a nice thing to hear.'Miss Edwards said she heard Fisher, Holcroft and Howley taunting the women 'at least a couple of times a week'.She also said she heard the women calling people 'fugly' behind their backs \u2013 although another witness, Jessica Skelly, told the court they used the term openly with at least one resident.'It was used to her. She used to get distressed and said she would phone the police,' she said.Describing the vile abuse meted out to the woman who was told she was working in a brothel, she added: 'Chloe, Jo and Nicole all referred to her as a prostitute\u2026 they said she wasn't pulling her weight.'Three of the workers regularly referred to one resident as a prostitute and told another she was fuglyAfter the group were found guilty, magistrates decided to send the case to Peterborough Crown Court for sentencing because their sentencing powers were insufficient to reflect the 'gravitas of the offences and the vulnerability of the victims'.Andrew Hurst, representing the women on Wednesday, said they continued to deny the offences. They were all dismissed from their jobs in February last year.A spokesman for the care home said: 'Everyone at the home is deeply shocked by the deplorable behaviour of these experienced carers.'A fifth carer, Benjamin Appiah, denies ill-treating three women and will stand trial in June.", "ref": "Judge had to set aside own feelings to give them an appropriate sentence..

But Tibetan Mastiffs are now so unpopular in China they are being sent to slaughterhouses \u2013 and their meat put into cheap hotpots.The dogs' dramatic decline in fortune is being partly blamed on the Chinese government's wide-reaching anti-corruption crackdown.Previously, wealthy businessmen would give the prized mastiffs to officials in the hope of influencing their decisions.Luo Yi, general manager of China's largest Tibetan Mastiff puppy farm, told People's Daily Online: 'The anti-corruption drive means people not daring to hand them out as gifts - nor would anyone take one as a gift.'It is also thought recent bans on owning dogs of more than 50kg in several Chinese cities - including Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin - has had a huge impact on the breed's popularity.Tibetan Mastiffs \u2013 which were traditionally used in Tibet to herd other animals and are known for their loyalty - can weigh up to 80kg.China's mastiff market collapse was revealed after animal-welfare workers rescued a group of the dogs that were being transported to a slaughterhouse.The abattoir they were heading to provides hotpot meat for restaurants. The dogs' skin can also be used for leather belts.Rescuers said they found the 20 mastiffs in cramped cages. A third of the dogs were already dead and none had been given food or water for three days. Several were suffering from broken bones.Shocking trade: Twenty Tibetan mastiffs were recently found crammed into cages on their way to a slaughterhouse like the dogs in this picture - taken on a motorway in the Chinese capital Beijing in 2009It is feared that across China hundreds of the dogs are meeting such a cruel fate.Mastiffs are also being stolen from the streets by ruthless gangs, who sell them to the slaughterhouses, say animal charities.Unscrupulous breeders are also offloading their 'imperfect' specimens to the abattoirs.Luo Yi, whose puppy farm is in Tibet, said some of his fellow breeders had damaged the quality of the breed to make more money. 'Driven by profits there was a lot of cross-breeding which resulted in a deterioration of the Tibetan mastiff in terms of appearance as well as temperament,' he explained.There was now a glut of poor-quality dogs that can't be sold, he added.Loyal: Tibetan mastiffs, like the one here, were originally used by people in Tibet to herd other animalsIn their heyday: A visitor plays with one of the dogs at a Tibetan mastiff show in Shenyang city four years agoMeanwhile, Chen Youjun a specialist in Tibetan mastiff photography, said: 'The rapid pace of urbanisation across China has made more and more people now realise Tibetan mastiffs are not animals well-suited to city living.'The breed's boom began in 2005 and led to the dogs being seen as status symbols. Just 13 months ago one puppy sold for \u00a31.2million, which is thought to be the highest price ever paid for a dog.A property develop bought the golden-haired one-year-old from breeder Zhang Gengyun in the eastern province of Zhejiang.Mr Zhang said of his dogs: 'They have lion's blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs.'Most expensive dog in the world: The gold-maned Tibetan mastiff pup (left) sold last year in east China for \u00a31.2million. The red pup of the same breed (right) fetched nearly \u00a3600,000. The dogs are seen with a model", "ref": "Tibetan Mastiffs had been status symbols for China's wealthiest.. They were given as gifts to grateful officials by businessmen.. One puppy was sold for \u00a31.2million to a property developer last year.. But an anti-corruption drive means the breed is now shunned.. Instead the dogs are sold to abattoirs for their meat and skin.", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 1.0, "accuracy": 1.0, "coverage": 1.0, "coherence": 5.0, "bert_score_p": 0.343743234872818,

Sushi and a former Labour backer.Dozens more company bosses have signed a letter backing Tory economic plans \u2013 including prominent former Labour supporter Simon Woodroffe, the founder of Yo! SushiOthers also include executives from two FTSE-100 firms and 10 from the FTSE-250 index. Adding their names were Philip Aiken, the chairman of construction giant Balfour Beatty, Dr Tom Enders, boss of Airbus, and Simon Litherland, head of drinks group Britvic.All have signed in a personal capacity.The announcement of the new names will heap pressure on Labour, which has struggled to come forward with notable numbers of business supporters.Once a former prominent Labour supporter, Mr Woodroffe appears to have turned his back on the party despite appearing in a 2004 political broadcast.Earlier this year, he warned that Labour's approach to business 'scares' him. He told BBC Newsnight: 'What I worry about with Ed Miliband is that he is appealing to the popular by saying, \"look at all these fat cats\" making lots of money it should be for the workers.''Actually, I think the fat cats generally, sometimes it annoys me, but they pay their taxes, you know.' By last night, a total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter warning against a 'change in course'The letter backs the lowering of corporation tax by David Cameron and George Osborne as it shows the UK is 'open for business' The letter states that the signatories believe the Conservative-led government 'has been good for business and pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation'.They praise the cuts in corporation tax to 20 per cent, which they say is a 'key part' of the Tory economic plan.They add: 'We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk.'When the letter was first published in a newspaper last week it sent shockwaves through the election campaign.Labour attempted to respond by positioning itself as the party of workers.It announced plans to ban 90 per cent of zero hours contracts and make it easier for staff to sue their bosses for wrongful dismissal.A poll of FTSE-100 chairman at the weekend showed seven out of ten think Mr Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain.The anonymous poll, published by the Sunday Times, showed widespread concern by businesses about Labour's economic plans.", "ref": "Yo!.

Graham White, 76, from Penarth said the changes to the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme'The 36 homes as they were before the council spent \u00a3750,000 including funds from the Intermediate Care Fund on the renovationOne pensioner, Graham White, 76, said residents think the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme than sheltered accommodation'.Mr White, who has lived in one of the flats for three years, told the BBC: 'It is a total waste of public money. The colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here.'They should put up a sign saying \"Welcome to Legoland\".' The residents' rent, of \u00a3103 a week plus bills, has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place. One neighbour, who lives opposite Redlands House and who did not wish to be named, described the building as an 'eyesore'.She said: 'It would be great if it was for kids. If it was a nursery it would look lovely. It looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it.'However Sue Barter, who lives on Redlands Avenue, said she was 'not indifferent to it'.She said: 'I can see how residents might not like it. It's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it. But I wouldn't complain about it.'Hayley Selway, head of housing for Vale of Glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to 'change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century'.Mr White said after the colourful renovations that: 'They should put up a sign saying \"Welcome to Legoland\".'She said: 'It is quite loud and vibrant. The design won't suit everyone's tastes and not everybody is going to like it.'This was about making a statement saying this is somewhere a little bit different.'She said the vibrant colours, both internal and external, were chosen to help residents with low levels of dementia and those with sight problems. She said plans for the redevelopment were on display for residents before any construction began and no concerns were raised prior to the work starting.She said: 'It is a matter of taste. Some residents rave about it. For others it is a huge departure from where they lived before but not everybody hates it.'Not impressed: Mr White stands outside the newly refurbished flats where he has lived for more than 3 years", "ref": "Locals say the bizarre refurbishment is more suitable for a playground..

{"i": "20abee584aa2b40fe8bec2d2511210896242e831", "src": "It's being billed as the Euro-derby in Madrid and depending on who you support the precedent is either last season's Champions League final or the six games that have been played between Real and Atletico since then.In Monday's pre-match press conference almost every question asked to Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti made reference to the fact that in six Madrid derbies this season Real are yet to win a single game \u2013 losing four and drawing two as Atletico have beaten them twice in the league and in the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa del Rey.But a remarkably relaxed Ancelotti, showing the kind of form in press room that he will hope his players show on the pitch Tuesday, reminded everyone that his team did not need to win. Two draws could see them go through so what was the problem? He said he didn't see Barcelona's slip on Saturday night against Sevilla because he was at the cinema 'enjoying a film' and when he was asked about Atletico Madrid's threat from set-pieces he responded: 'Don't forget we won the Champions League with a set-piece last season.'Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti says he is not obsessed with Atletico Madrid ahead of Tuesday's clashMadrid-based papers Marca (left) and AS are looking ahead to the Champions League quarter-final first legSergio Ramos (centre) scored an injury-time equaliser for Real as they beat Atletico 4-1 aet in the Champions League final last season at Benfica's Stadium of Light in LisbonHowever, Atletico are unbeaten in six Madrid derbies this term and dumped Real out of the Copa del ReyHis reference to Sergio Ramos' injury-time goal against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon that levelled Diego Godin's header and allowed Real to run in riot in extra-time will have struck a chord with Real supporters who in the build-up to the game have been busy reminding their rivals that while they may have won none of the last six meetings they did come out on top in the match that mattered more than any other.Real Madrid are at full strength for the game and that seems to have left Ancelotti as upbeat and confident as at any time so far this season. He toyed with his Spanish inquisitors when they questioned him about whether or not Gareth Bale would start the game. The Welshman was rested at the weekend but will be in the XI on Tuesday night.'If Bale is not 100 percent fit he will not play because we have everyone available' said Ancelotti leaving a pregnant pause. But as the possibility that Spanish favourite Isco might start the game presented itself the Italian coach added: 'But he is 100 percent.'He added: 'Bale was fantastic last season but had been really good this season. He came good in the big finals scoring in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals so let's see how he performs now in the final months of the season.' Gareth Bale (centre) is set to start for Real after being rested at the weekend against Eibar on SaturdayLike Ramos, Bale was also on target during Real's Champions League final success over Atletico last seasonThe feeling among Real Madrid's coaching staff is that while Bale has been criticised by the Madrid press for not being the team player that Isco is, his ability to win a big final with a goal or an assist is unmatchable.Anelotti added: 'I am not obsessed with Atletico Madrid,' mentioning 'attitude' several times in his positive discourse and admitting that was the key missing ingredient from Real Madrid's 4-0 defeat to Atletico in February. He said facing Simeone was 'honour and a problem' and picked out Atletico Madrid's resilience when asked what their greatest quality was. 'They fight from the first minute to the last,' he said.Atletico Madrid fans believe that fight will see them overcome Real Madrid for the seventh time this season and the Vicente Calderon will be full for what, with their title hopes now gone, is their game of the season.Real's swagger has been rediscovered though, wth the return of key players Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and Luka Modric.Ancelotti recalled the moment Modric' corner was headed in by Ramos in Lisbon. 'It's a wonderful memory,' he said. 'Now we have the challenge of going for Real Madrid's 11th European Cup.Real know they face a stern test against an Atletico side that beat them 4-0 when they last met in FebruaryAncelotti hails pitting his wits against Atletico boss Diego Simeone as an 'honour and a problem'The return of midfielder Luka Modric (centre) from injury has revitalised Real in recent weeks", "ref": "Atletico Madrid host Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night ..

Then you're not Marleni Olivo, who did exactly that, and in return is getting the new apartment she was asking for, said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.Olivo, 54, saw her opportunity when Maduro visited Anzoategui, the state where she lives.Maduro, a former bus driver, drove a bus to a rally Wednesday where he was meeting with supporters. The president had the window open, the better to greet people attending the rally.Olivo had written a message on a mango -- \"If you can, call me,\" -- along with her name and phone number. She got as close as she could and, as the bus passed, she tossed the fruit at Maduro.In a video that has gone viral in Venezuela, Maduro is shown lowering his head when he is hit, just above the left ear. He then calmly picks up the mango and holds it up to the crowd.Later in the evening, the president mentioned the incident in one of his customary live TV broadcasts and displayed the infamous mango as proof.\"Marleni Olivo,\" Maduro said. \"We're going to invite her to my [TV and radio] show, 'In Touch with Maduro.' She had a housing problem, right? And, Marleni, I have approved it already, as part of the Great Housing Mission of Venezuela, you will get an apartment and it will be given to you in the next few hours. Tomorrow, no later than the day after tomorrow, we will give it to you.\"Maduro also joked that he had something in common with the mango. The word \"maduro\" in Spanish means ripe.Olivo told local media her intention was to toss the president a note, as others in the crowd were doing.\"I didn't have paper available at that moment,\" she told El Pitazo TV. \"What I had was a mango that I was about to eat because I was hungry.\"Maduro's critics are calling the incident a \"manguicidio,\" a play on the words \"mango\" and \"magnicidio,\" a Spanish word meaning assassination of a powerful leader.

'I have always strongly believed that life begins at conception and that every embryo is life on the journey towards birth,' businessman Nick Loeb, said in a statement.'I created these two female embryos with the purpose of taking them to term and not destruction, because I have always dreamed of being a father.'  Scroll down for video... Drama: Sofia Vergara's ex Nick Loeb (pictured here together in May last year) says he's always 'dreamed' of being a father ...as he defends lawsuit to keep frozen embryosThe 39-year-old filed a lawsuit last August over the two embryos. On Monday he implied that he wants to use them to have children of his own - either with the involvement of his 42-year-old ex or without her. 'I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind,' his statement, released through his lawyer Mark J. Heller, said.'I take the responsibility and obligation of being a parent very seriously.'In a full statement to UsWeekly Loeb added: 'Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right.' Loeb is a a scion of the Loeb and Lehman families and his father ran the prestigious Wall Street investment firm Loeb, Rhoades & Co. before becoming US Ambassador to Denmark and a delegate to the United Nations.  Loeb and Vergara created the embryos through in vitro fertilization in November 2013 and they remain frozen at a Beverly Hills clinic.In a full statement released to UsWeekly Nick said: 'I have always strongly believed that life begins at fertilization and that every embryo is a life on the journey towards birth. I created these two female embryos with the purpose of taking them to term and not destruction, because I have always dreamed of being a father. I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind. I take the responsibility and obligation of being a parent very seriously. Creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations, even where a man doesn't want to become a father. Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right. However life comes to be created, it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent.'Vergara, TV's highest paid actress and one of Hollywood's hottest stars, denies that she wants to destroy the embryos - but says she has no desire to have children with her ex-fianc\u00e9, either.Last week, the Colombian beauty said through her attorney that her plan is to keep the embryos frozen indefinitely. She has a 22-year-old son Manolo with ex-husband Joe Gonzalez. Vergara broke up with Loeb last May after nearly two years of engagement. Last Christmas, she became engaged to True Blood star Joe Manganiello.

Booker Jr. of Topeka, an American citizen also known as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, was taken into custody near Manhattan, Kansas, in a van that contained what he thought was a bomb, the criminal complaint said.The \"bomb\" had actually been put together by two confidential informants with nonexplosive materials, the complaint said. Fort Riley's security was never breached and no people were in danger, the U.S. Justice Department said in a press release.Booker enlisted in the Army last year and was due to ship out to basic training April 7, 2014, said Army spokesman Wayne Hall. The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, \"Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush. I am so nervous. NOT because I'm scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord.\"Booker waived his Miranda rights and told the agents he enlisted to commit an insider attack against American soldiers like Maj. Nidal Hassan had done at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaint said. Hassan opened fire in a building in November 2009, killing 13 people and wounding more than 30.His enlistment was terminated March 24, 2014, at the request of Army Criminal Investigation Command, Hall said.Booker began communicating with a confidential informant later in 2014, the complaint said, and often talked about his plans to engage in violent jihad in support of ISIS. He and the informant watched ISIS videos together, the complaint said, and Booker talked about how he wanted to go to Iraq and turn his weapon on American soldiers when ordered to shoot the enemy.On March 9, Booker said he believed ISIS wanted him to commit a truck bombing in the United States and thought a good target would be nearby Fort Riley, a large Army base that's home to the 1st Infantry Division, known as \"The Big Red One.\"Booker said \"that detonating a suicide bomb is his No. 1 aspiration because he couldn't be captured, all evidence would be destroyed and he would be guaranteed to hit his target,\"  the criminal complaint said.He made a video with a Fort Riley airfield in the background and said ISIS was coming to kill American soldiers, both abroad and in the United States, the complaint said.Booker acquired components for a bomb and rented a storage locker to store the components, the complaint said. The plan was for confidential informants to build a bomb and for Booker to drive to Fort Riley and detonate it, the complaint said. But the bomb was built with \"inert\" parts and would never explode, the complaint said.On Friday, the informants and Booker drove to what Booker thought was a little-used utility gate near Fort Riley, the complaint said. While Booker was making final connections on the \"bomb,\" the FBI arrested him, the complaint said.He was charged with one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, one count of attempting to damage property by means of an explosive and one count of attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq, a designated foreign terrorist organization.If convicted, he could face life in prison.Alexander E. Blair, 28, of Topeka was taken into custody Friday and charged with failing to report a felony.The FBI said agents interviewed Blair after Booker's arrest. Blair said he shared some of Booker's views, knew of his plans to detonate a vehicle bomb at Fort Riley and loaned him money to rent storage space, according to the FBI's criminal complaint. He said he thought Booker would carry out his plan but did not contact authorities, the complaint said.If convicted, Blair faces a maximum of three years in prison.", "ref": "Alexander Blair, 28, of Topeka accused of knowing about bomb plot but not contacting authorities..

Mr Postgate told the FT: 'Rather than trying to deliver one large project, we've been taking off the different components and moving forward.'Last year it was announced that BBC Three, the youth-oriented digital TV channel, will be taken off the air and become internet-only.The move could herald a new wave of services moving to the internet - but Mr Postgate insisted that other channels will remain on broadcast TV for the time being, saying: 'BBC Three was a brand that you could move from one platform to another relatively easily.'Mr Postgate also predicted that more and more BBC services will be consumed via mobile phones and tablet computers rather than on traditional channels.He wrote in a blog post last night: 'We will increasingly use the internet to deliver programmes and services to you in the future - whether that's to the big screen in the living room or the smartphones and tablets scattered over the house.'Radio 1, which is also aimed primarily at young people, has expanded its online offerings via sites such as YouTube - controller Ben Cooper said last month that it was 'no longer a music station' but a 'multi-platform youth music brand'.Future: The BBC has increasingly been promoting its services on digital platforms such as iPlayerFigures released in November showed that children spend half as much time as adults watching ordinary broadcast TV, but much more time watching online video.If the trend continues, the television licence fee could be under threat as viewers opt out of the \u00a3145.50 payment and watch online instead.It is thought that around 500,000 people take advantage of the so-called 'iPlayer loophole', but that figure is likely to rise if more BBC services become online-only.MPs recently called for the licence fee to be amended so that viewers who only use catch-up services will have to pay it.Mr Postgate said in a statement today: 'I'm not talking about the BBC only putting its content online. My role is to make sure that the BBC's technologies that underpin everything we do - from our newsroom infrastructure and new in-the-field production and editing tools, to how we keep the BBC on air and online - are set up in the best possible way, and take advantage of new internet-based technologies.'When the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was launched in 2008, it was hailed by BBC chiefs as 'the single most important initiative we are working on'.But before a year had elapsed, it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as 'Don't Mention It.'The BBC originally appointed IT firm Siemens to implement the scheme. But it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered and took it back in-house.By then, \u00a326million had already been wasted but it is understood the BBC later recouped the cost from Siemens.In February 2011, the National Audit Office condemned the corporation over its handling of the DMI after it ran 21 months behind schedule.The public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated.The Public Accounts Committee criticised the BBC for awarding the contract to Siemens without putting it out to open tender.The project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and audio material on their computers.As hundreds of staff moved to the corporation's new headquarters in Salford, this would prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from London, reducing production costs.But the costs of the project continued to spiral to \u00a398.4million until it was finally halted in May 2013.", "ref": "BBC is aiming to compete with internet services which have captured younger generation of viewers..

She initially had surgery to remove tumours from her neck that September and she then underwent a course of radiation treatment to 'mop up' the cancer in December.But when a return visit to the doctors revealed cancer cells had spread to other parts of her body, Ms Fox rejected further conventional medical treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online. Scroll down for video  As a model, Candice Marie-Fox (right) rubbed shoulders with the likes of last year's Bachelor Blake GarveyJuice in hand: Candice-Marie Fox (pictured) claims to have cured her cancer with a nutritional program involving the heavy consumption of pineapples Ms Fox underwent surgery and radiation treatment. She is planning to release relevant medical records without her personal details'I was feeling a bit lost, just winging it on the internet myself,' she said, until she discovered a U.S. organisation called the Nutritional Oncology Research Institute.She would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit-only diet, taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive-thinking dance group called The Liberators International. Her diet program involved her drinking 'morning juice', dipping into boxes of pineapples each hour and taking vitamins. Ms Fox said when she returned to the doctors months after embracing her new lifestyle, medical staff found her cancer had been radically reduced in size and is now gone. 'I have got rid of it all (the cancer) 100 per cent myself through just hardcore nutrition, loving myself and meditating, adopting all stuff I thought never would have worked,' she said. Bloggers have questioned that assertion, demanding medical evidence for her claims and questioning her understanding of her radiation treatment. 'I am merely requesting that you are transparent about something as serious as being able to cure cancer using nutritional means,' one wrote.'The truth is not negative or mean or bullying in any way whatsoever.' In response, Ms Fox said she was applying to obtain all her relevant medical records, which will take 45 to 60 days to obtain. She is planning release them in a PDF file, without personal details such as her Medicare number and contact details.Ms Fox also said she is seeking a trusted independent investigator to examine her claims and insisted she is not promoting her cause for fame or money.'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.'Ms Fox (pictured) has been questioned by bloggers over claims she cured her cancer through a diet as well as meditation As part of the modelling world, Ms Fox is friends with The Bachelor Blake Garvey'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.''All I know is, she's not me, I'm not her. 'My story is so far removed from anybody else's story because it's mine. 'It's unique, and it's exactly how it happened. 'So why am I not allowed to share that? 'Why am I not allowed to help people heal? I'm not making money out of this, I'm not trying to hurt anyone.''I'm not a fraud and I'm not a fake'. Ms Fox said she 'totally understood' that people were sceptical and that people were concerned her message could discourage people from seeking conventional treatments - but that wasn't her agenda. 'It just seems they've got this massive agenda to break down my story. 'I know I can sleep at night and in my heart I am doing what I know to be right.''I haven't changed anything, I haven't deleted anything. 'It really did change the way I f***ing lived'.Cancer Council nutritionist Kathy Chapman said maintaining a healthy diet is 'one of the things you can do to support your treatment', but dismissed 'magic diets' as unproven.  'I think it's really important for anybody who is facing cancer that they put their faith in medical doctors who are going to be backed up by sound research,' Ms Chapman said. 'A lot of the people claiming these cures with special magic diets you need to ask - where's the scientific studies there to back them up, and they are missing in this case.'Oncologist Dr Ian Olver, the director of the Samsom Institute, said there was evidence a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables with less red meat could prevent cancer. But Dr Olver, from the University of South Australia, said there was little evidence to suggest food could cure cancer and that he was concerned about the popularity of so-called 'wellness warriors'. 'People may be lured into abandoning or not taking up potentially curative treatments because something's become popular for which there is no evidence. 'Even if someone claimed they were cured by a certain diet, you'd like to know if that happened one in two (cases) or one in 20000 - but these anecdotes get blown up into suggestions for lifestyle.'

'In theory he is facing five years in prison and a fine, but even a suspended sentence of just half an hour in jail would be too much.'Karabatic, who was briefly detained when the case emerged, now plays for Barcelona in the Spanish league. Karabatic leaves the Montpellier's courtroom after attending his appeal in October 2012Other former or current Montpellier players including Mladen Bojinovic, Samuel Honrubia, Dragan Gagic, Primoz Prost, Issam Tej and Mickael Robin will also be tried.Karabatic has denied placing bets on the match that Montpellier lost 31-28 to Cesson-Rennes.Betting authority Francaise de Jeux reported an unusually high increase in betting at halftime in the match, raising suspicions and triggering a police investigation.

Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department.Charged: (From left to right) Charles Thomas Newcomb, Thomas Jordan Driver, and David Elliot Moran each were arrested Thursday on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office saidBondi's office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists.The FBI was initially alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. The FBI's affidavit described the informant as 'a confidential human source for the FBI whose motivation for cooperation with the FBI is patriotism.' The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter's 'Exalted Cyclops' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations.In late 2014, authorities say Driver provided the Klan chapter, called a klavern, with a photograph of the inmate, who'd been let out on supervised release.'Both Driver and Moran ... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) \"six feet under,\"' the FBI's affidavit said.The informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate - ranging from shooting him to injecting with a lethal dose of insulin, which Newcomb said 'would be quieter.' In the recordings, the men often refer to the man using a racial epithet. The affidavit said the informant, Moran and Newcomb went on a trip together to where the inmate lives in Palatka. Before they made the trip, 'Newcomb pointed out that if they could grab (the inmate) and take him to the river, he would need to bring a fishing pole to make it look like (the inmate) was at the river fishing,' the affidavit said.'Newcomb told (the informant) he wanted to make it as realistic as possible, but if they had to go in there blazin, they would do what they had to do,' the affidavit continued. Their first attempt to find and kill the inmate failed. 'The FBI pre-arranged to have a law enforcement presence in the area of (the inmate's) residence to prevent a crime being committed that day,' the affidavit said. 'A vehicle with police lights was staged on the same street a block away from (the inmate's) residence and a police patrol vehicle aggressively roved the neighborhood to establish an active law enforcement response.'The informant later recorded a conversation with Driver to confirm he still wanted him dead.'Okay, but do you want this guy terminated?' the informant asked.'I think for this individual...I think a message isn't going to do him any good,' Driver replied, according to the affidavit.'Okay so I take that as a yes?' the informant said.'Yes sir,' Driver said, according to the affidavit.In March, the FBI gave the informant a burner cellphone with a doctored photograph that appeared to show the inmate had been fatally shot. The informant showed all three men the photograph and recorded their jubilant reactions.'According to (the informant), Newcomb smiled upon seeing the photograph that depicted that (the inmate) had been shot and killed,' the affidavit said. Moran, whom the men referred to as 'Sarge,' was smiling when he saw the photograph that depicted the inmate had been murdered, according to the informant.'Moran also gave (the informant) an enthusiastic handshake upon seeing the photograph,' according to the affidavit. 'Driver smiled, nodded his head in a yes motion and shook the (informant's) hand in gratitude,' according to the affidavit.Bondi said and corrections department officials were quick to condemn the suspects' alleged actions, but the incident highlights an ongoing stream of high-profile problems in Florida's prison system.Last fall, prison system officials fired nearly 50 employees, including several over allegations that they punched and beat inmates.The deaths of inmates Randall Jordan-Aparo and Darren Rainey also drew attention.Jordan-Aparo was reportedly gassed while in a confinement cell at the Franklin Correctional Institution.Rainey, a mentally ill prisoner, was punished in 2012 with a shower so hot that his skin separated from his body at Dade Correctional Institution. The warden there was fired.Reaching out: The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has garnered attention for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. A recent flyer from the Klan provided by WTXL-TV is seen hereIncident: The state said the murder plotting started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center (pictured) in rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmateDepartment of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones, who was hired late last year to lead the troubled agency, called the arrests 'disquieting.''We are moving swiftly to terminate the employees arrested today and working closely with Office of the Attorney General to assist in their prosecution,' she said in a written statement.'Our Department has zero tolerance for racism or prejudice of any kind. The actions of these individuals are unacceptable and do not, in any way, represent the thousands of good, hardworking honorable correctional officers employed at the Department of Corrections.'The case will be prosecuted in Columbia County in north Florida.Driver and Moran are being held in Union County jail. Newcomb is in Alachua County Jail with bond set at $750,000.Frank Ancona, imperial wizard of the KKK group to which the three men were said to belong, did not confirm or deny their membership.'We at the TAK do not in any way condone, tolerate, or support any type of illegal activity in our organization and because of this we would stand by any of our members pending a decision by a court of law, not a decision of the court of media or public opinion,' Ancona said.", "ref": "Thomas Driver, David Moran, and Charles Newcomb each were arrested  on one state count of conspiracy to commit murder..

In that attack, police arrested more than 200 people for various crimes including rape, murder, robbery and theft.CNN's Larry Register contributed to this report.", "ref": "South Africa is battling xenophobic violence after some said foreigners are taking jobs away..

They have won the European Cup twice and would dearly love a third.Standing in their way of a semi-final appearance is Monaco, the surprise team to make it through after their remarkable win over Arsenal in the previous round.At the Emirates, Leonardo Jardim's team were adventurous and audacious, surprising Arsenal with their breathtaking approach to the game. They are not to be underestimated.Gianluca Vialli lifts the Champions League for Juventus in 1996 - the last time the Bianconeri were victoriousIn 2003, Juventus suffered heartbreak in the Champions League final, losing to AC Milan in a penalty shootoutDespite the big, high-profile exits of James Rodriguez to Real Madrid and Radamel Falcao's season-long loan to Manchester United, they are difficult to beat.Joao Moutinho is a classy player in the centre of their midfield and the France international Jeremy Toulalan can always pick out a pass.Up front is Dimitar Berbatov, one of the scorers at the Emirates on the night of that incredible and climactic 3-1 victory in the first leg.Dimitar Berbatov is one of the men standing in Juventus' way in their Champions League quarter-finalTevez is adored by Juventus supporters and they will hope he is the man to help them to European gloryIt was after that game when Arsene Wenger headed straight for the tunnel, failing to shake the hand of Monaco's Portuguese coach following Arsenal's defeat.When Monaco scraped through on away goals, Jardim made a point of calling Wenger 'disrespectful' for his behaviour, which is familiar to all English football fans, on the touchline.Here in Turin, the Monaco coach talked of being worthy of their place in the quarter-final, good enough to live with the very best teams left in the tournament.Now, inside this magnificent new stadium, they get to meet one of them.", "ref": "Juventus face Monaco in uefa Champions League quarters on Tuesday..

Deputies in DeKalb, in the Atlanta area, tracked down Kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said.Kennedy is from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and has been a student at Middle Tennessee State University, the sheriff's office said.Previously, Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, the sheriff's office said. Calhoun was released Saturday after posting $50,000 bond; Martistee remains in Bay County Jail, a county deputy said.Troy University in Alabama said the two are students and have been \"placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team.\"Martistee is represented by a public defender. Calhoun's legal representation is unclear. No public statement has been made on either's behalf.The arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched.The woman didn't recall the assault, police say, but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news, and though the footage had to be blurred, she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities.It's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in Panama City Beach, authorities say.Four young men were involved in the assault, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said, and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness, it's unclear if the person arrested Tuesday was someone the police had been looking for.\"There's hundreds, hundreds of people standing there -- watching, looking, seeing, hearing what's going on,\" McKeithen said. \"And yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere. I will tell you it is not acceptable in Bay County.\"Authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects, said Ruth Corley, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office.Authorities are pressing charges, and the woman plans to cooperate, Corley said. Investigators were to meet with her this week.After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place between March 10 and March 12, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers.She \"does not remember the assault at all,\" Corley said. \"She remembers taking a drink from a CamelBak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged.\" (CamelBak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks.)She was visiting Panama City Beach at the time of the assault, and is now home, authorities said.The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office.The video shows suspects pushing the victim's hand aside and holding her legs down, Corley said. \"You can see in the video there are people two feet away. They were assaulting her, and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted.\"The suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her, Corley said.Authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened, Corley said.The sheriff's office released part of the video to local TV stations, which blurred portions of it before airing. CNN is showing part of what was released.While the video is \"one of the most disgusting, repulsive, sickening things that I've seen this year on Panama City Beach,\" it's not an isolated incident, McKeithen said.\"This is not the first video we've recovered. It's not the second video. It's not the third video. There's a number of videos we've recovered with things similar to this, and I can only imagine how many things we haven't recovered.\"Corley said that through social media, \"we have been able to find video of girls, incoherent and passed out, and almost like they are drugged, being assaulted on the beaches of Panama City in front of a bunch of people standing around.\"About 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year. This year, the Bay County Sheriff's Office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year.CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Josh Levs and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.", "ref": "Third suspect identified as George Davon Kennedy of Murfreesboro, Tennessee..

But about 20,000 people died from execution, starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint, according to war crimes prosecutors; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination, where many met similar fates.The urban evacuation marked the first phase in the Khmer Rouge's revolutionary program of social engineering, intended to establish a new order -- free of money, family ties, religion, education, property and foreign influence.Aimed at creating an agrarian utopia, it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era, resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians -- about a quarter of the country's population -- over the next four years.Ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings, three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years, before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979.His killing prompted Ly to leave her sole remaining family member, youngest sister Bo, in the care of a local couple. She set out on her own, making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the United States.For more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister.\"I think she was the only family member to survive,\" she says, with tears in her eyes.As she finishes her story, the producers usher a woman on the stage. It's Bo.Ly embraces her sister and both women sob.\"I missed you so much,\" Ly says.\"I've always searched for you,\" Bo tells her.Since production began five years ago, the television show, \"It's Not A Dream,\" has reunited members of 54 Cambodian families shattered by the genocide. More than 1,500 have sought its help.The series is just one example of the ways in which Cambodia's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught, painful business of reckoning with their history.\"The scars of the Khmer Rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern Cambodia,\" said Theary Seng, a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime, and who moved to the U.S. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult.She described the country as a \"land of orphans.\"For decades after the Khmer Rouge were driven from Phnom Penh by Soviet-backed Vietnamese forces in January 1979, the regime's crimes were seldom spoken about, let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims.In large part, this was because people remained scared, say experts.Far from being snuffed out by the Vietnamese invasion, the Khmer Rouge existed for another two decades.After fleeing the capital in 1979, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west.They continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government-in-exile that, until 1990, was recognized by the U.N. as the country's only legitimate representative.\"In many villages, people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades,\" said Krisna Uk, executive director of the Center for Khmer Studies.Craig Etcheson, a Cambodia expert at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University, said that \"for many years, there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the Khmer Rouge, as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room.\"The silence was also due to the fact that Cambodians, in Seng's words, \"lacked the vocabulary\" of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society.The Khmer Rouge's attempts to reboot society at \"Year Zero\" had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country's educated classes -- doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, merchants and clergy.\"Nearly two generations of young Cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill,\" said Etcheson. \"When it was finally time to rebuild, there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again.\"Even today, said Uk, young Cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school.In an impoverished country -- one of Asia's poorest, albeit with 7% predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back, she said.Some were even skeptical that the Khmer Rouge's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the \"killing fields\" -- had really occurred, she added.The space for discussing, redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, said Seng.Founded in 2006, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) is a \"hybrid\" tribunal using both Cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the Khmer Rouge's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice.Intended as a southeast Asian equivalent of the Nuremberg trials, the tribunal, which has cost $232 million so far, initially enjoyed broad support.\"We had great hope for this process,\" said Seng. \"The presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the Khmer Rouge crimes.\"But the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial, given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals, two of whom have died while facing trial. Another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial. (The Khmer Rouge's top leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998, having never faced charges.)This, coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the Cambodian government, has soured attitudes towards the court.Seng, who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings, today regards it as a \"sham.\" For many victims, it is \"too little, too late.\"OPINION: An ongoing struggle for justice after the Khmer RougeIn the first case heard, Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Comrade Duch -- commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture.The court's only other verdicts, delivered in August last year, sentenced Non Chea, the regime's \"Brother Number Two,\" and Khieu Samphan, \"Brother Number Four,\" to life. Both men have appealed their convictions.In a separate case, the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. Evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016, ECCC spokesman Lars Olsen said.Two further, and highly controversial cases, known as 003 and 004, are also currently under investigation.Three people were charged last month in relation to those cases: former Khmer Rouge navy commander Meas Muth; Im Chaem, a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp; and Ao An, a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers. Two other suspects are being investigated.Olsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004.Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia's strongman leader for decades, has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004, claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war.Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge battalion commander, who defected to the Vietnamese side; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like Seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal.Others are more forgiving of the tribunal's shortcomings.Etcheson, a former investigator for the tribunal, has described it as an \"imperfect vessel\" for delivering justice, but says Cambodia's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives: delivering justice for victims, and completing the reintegration of former Khmer Rouge into society.He said the most important aspects of the tribunal's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in Cambodian society.\"In that respect, the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped,\" he added.Undoubtedly, Cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece.Krisna Uk said the country has seen a wave of Khmer Rouge memoirs, written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die.\"There's a lot of people who want to tell the world they've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad,\" she said.Khieu Samphan, \"Brother Number Four,\" published one such effort ahead of his trial, while Sikoeun Suong, a Sorbonne-educated former diplomat for the Khmer Rouge regime, published his \"Journey of a Khmer Rouge Intellectual\" in French in 2013.He told an interviewer from France's Le Monde last year that he believed that Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot's prescriptions for Cambodia were sound.\"I remain convinced that the Marxist analysis made by Pol Pot of the socioeconomic situation of Cambodia, a poor and sparsely populated country, was correct,\" he said.For survivors, these self-serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take.But for a few of them, at least, Cambodia's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing, however bittersweet.On the stage of the \"It's Not a Dream\" studio, as Ly hugs her long-lost sister, footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen.\"Do you know the person in the video?\" the show's host asks.\"Yes,\" Ly says. \"She is my mother.\"Moments later, Te Souymoy, 77, is brought up on stage.\"Where have you two been?\" Te asks. \"I always worried about you two.\"\"I thought you died,\" Ly says.The three women cry and embrace.\"It is very miserable for all of us,\" the old woman says.", "ref": "Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, fell to the genocidal Khmer Rouge 40 years ago today.. At least 1.7 million people were killed in the subsequent Four years, before the regime was driven out.. Decades on, the country is still struggling to gain justice For victims and heal from the genocide.", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 3.0, "accuracy": 3.0, "coverage": 3.0, "coherence": 4.0,

Scroll down for video Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in BermudaThe two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them.The Royal Gazette reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning.The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin.Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.'Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head.Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a planeRichardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner.Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight.   The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers.In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally.Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair.'In these times it could be a lot harsher \u2013 you can't mess around in the air these days,' he said.  A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport.'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody.'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.' It is not known at this time as to the nationality or the exact actions of the two passengers arrestedA spokesperson for Thomson Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by passengers on board flight TOM022 from London Gatwick Airport to Cancun, which diverted to Bermuda yesterday due to a customer incident on board.'We operate a zero tolerance policy in relation to any disruptive behaviour. The passengers in question were removed from the aircraft and met by police. 'The flight departed within two hours to ensure the other customers could get away on their holiday as soon as possible.'Customer safety is our priority at all times and we would like to reassure passengers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'", "ref": "Pair named as jamie Richardson and Daniel Taylor from West Sussex..

They also have three sepals, which sometimes look like other petals, and a single column at the centre which is used during reproduction. Researchers have found its shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins. They converted lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing (illustrated)Conversion of lips into sepal/petal-like structures in Oncidium and Phalaenopsis orchids is shownOrchids have three sepals, which sometimes look like other petals, and a single column at the centre.Lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction.To discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, researchers  from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development.They found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals.The have called this mechanism the Perianth code and discovered that orchid species from many subfamilies with different types of lips and petals all obey it.The experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing.Lips attract insect pollinators and serve as a landing platform for them, which is thought to have given orchids an evolutionary advantage over other flowers, by promoting reproduction. Lips are differently coloured, ruffled or pouch-shaped, depending on the species, and can be decorated with horns, hairs, warts, teeth and tails to attract specific pollinators.These range from bees to flies, gnats, moths, butterflies, hummingbirds and even bats in some tropical climates.To discover why the flowers developed their distinctive lips, Chang-Hsien Yang and his colleagues from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development.They found that in mature orchid flowers, the expression pattern suggests two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex and the 'SP' complex, compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals.The have called this mechanism the Perianth code and discovered that orchid species from many subfamilies with different types of lips and petals all obey it.The experts were also able to convert lips into petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing.The scientists studied the expression of a class of genes known to be associated with petal development. They found that in mature orchid flowers,  two protein complexes, called the 'L' complex (red) and the 'SP' complex (blue), compete to form the lip and petals. This competition and balancing act is illustrated aboveThe pastel-coloured orchid mantis has fascinated naturalists for more than a century.It was popularly thought that the insect, whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch prey.But earlier this year, scientists suggested that the mantis doesn't simply blend into flowers, but is attractive to insects in its own right, sometimes preferring to remain more easily visible on leaves.It was popularly thought that the orchid mantis (pictured), whose legs are flattened and heart-shaped to resemble petals, simply mimics an orchid, allowing it to 'hide' and catch preyDr James O'Hanlon of Macquarie University, Australia, set about systematically testing the ideas contained within the traditional view of the orchid mantis' modus operandi.First, his team tested whether mantises actually camouflage among flowers, or, alternatively, attract insects on their own.For a flower-seeking insect, as predicted, the mantis' colour pattern is indistinguishable from most common flowers.However, when paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora.'We can clearly observe insects, like bees, diverging from their flight paths and flying right towards this deceptive predator,' Dr O'Hanlon said.When paired alongside the most common flower in their habitat, insects approached mantises more often than flowers, showing that mantises are attractive to insects by themselves, rather than simply camouflaging among the flora. Here, an orchid mantis eats a Tiger heliconian butterfly in MalaysiaThey also found that mantises did not choose to hide among the flowers, but selected leaves to sit on, just as often.Sitting near flowers did bring benefits, though, because insects were attracted to the general vicinity.When they compared the mantis's shape and colour with flowers from an insect's perspective, the predator did not resemble an orchid or indeed any particular species of flower, but rather a 'generalised' flower.They may exploit a loophole created by evolutionary efficiency savings within the insect brain.The compact brains of insects use a rule of thumb - anything matching colour X is a nectar-containing flower \u2013 and the predator uses 'sensory exploitation' to catch its victims.Sensory exploitation is a concentrated mass of the right colour. The insect classifies the mantis as a giant nectar-filled flower and approaches to investigate \u2013 to its doom.", "ref": "Orchid has evolved a 'lip' - irregular modified petal - to attract insects ..

Both sides started strongly, but it was the Sounders' Lamar Neagle had the first chance of the game after nine minutes, flicking on from a cross that was tipped over the crossbar by Jaime Pendeo.Neagle again saw a header blocked by the keeper after 21 minutes and though it was the visitors with the best of the early chances, one minute later the Galaxy were ahead.Juninho sent a cross dep into the penalty area and centre back Omar Gonzalez rose to direct it back across Stefan Frei's goal. The Swiss goalkeeper scrambled to re-adjust but was beaten to it by Gordon who could hardly miss and duly put the Galaxy into the lead.Neagle had a third chance on the stroke of half-time but couldn't find the net having exploded through the Galaxy defence only to place his shot too close to Penedo who saved easily, diving to his right.The home side went in at the break ahead, and they came close to doubling their lead almost immediately after the break when Robbie Rogers shot low, forcing Frei into a sharp save at his near post. Juninho fired wide from distance moments later.Brad Evans  of Seattle Sounders wins a high ball against Galaxy goalscorer  Gordon in the first halfBut back came the Sounders, and they should have levelled when Andy Rose latched on to a low cross but fired straight at Penedo from point-blank range when anywhere else would have led to a goal.The remainder of the game saw few clear-cut chances. Obafemi Martins had an effort easily saved from distance and while the home side looked dangerous on the break they often failed with the final ball.And so Gordon's strike proved enough as Galaxy claimed just their second win of the 2015 MLS season.", "ref": "Alan Gordon put La Galaxy into the lead after 23 minutes with a header..

Among those sentenced to life in prison is Mohamed Soltan, an American-Egyptian man who has been on a hunger strike over his detention for more than 14 months. Soltan's family called for Mohamed's immediate release in a statement after the verdict, charging that there was no evidence against him.His father Salah Soltan was among the 14 detainees sentenced to death.The U.S. embassy in Cairo said in a statement that it was 'gravely concerned' about Mohamed Soltan and would 'continue to monitor his case closely and to provide him with all possible support.'Sentenced: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Badie (front) and his fellow defendants were found guilty of plotting unrest in the months after the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013Ruling: Egyptian Judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata reads the verdicts in a cases in Cairo, on SaturdayThe rulings can be appealed before the Court of Cassation, which has overturned dozens of other death sentences, including against Badie.So far Egypt has executed one Islamist sentenced to death after Morsi's overthrow, following his conviction of involvement in the murder of a youth during violent protests in July 2013.Judge Shehata read out a Koranic verse that stipulates amputation and crucifixion for outlaws, before rendering his verdict on Saturday.At a previous session, he had sought the opinion of the country's mufti, the Islamic legal authority who has an advisory role under Egyptian law, on the death sentences.Known as the 'Rabaa Operations Room' case, the prosecution accused the defendants of organising months of unrest and protests against the ouster of Morsi, a senior Brotherhood figure himself now on trial. The Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp in Cairo was dispersed by police on August 14, 2013 in a 12-hour operation that left hundreds of protesters and about 10 policemen dead.Supporters of Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi stand their ground as Egyptian security forces move in to disperse them by force from the Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp in Cairo in August 2013Mohamed Soltan was shot in the arm during the dispersal, and he was arrested days later as police hunted down Islamist activists who had fled the protest camp.Police moved in to disperse the camp after weeks of failed European and US-brokered negotiations with the Brotherhood, who publicly insisted on Morsi's return.The Islamist was the country's first freely elected president and he ruled only for a year before the army toppled him, spurred by massive protests demanding his resignation.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who toppled Morsi and then won an election, has pledged to eradicate the Brotherhood.The government has blacklisted the movement as a terrorist organisation amid a spike in militant attacks that have killed dozens of policemen and soldiers.The deadliest attacks have been claimed by jihadists in the Sinai Peninsula and in Cairo, and the Brotherhood insists it is committed to non-violence.But decapitated and driven underground, the Islamist movement is believed to have radicalised with members adopting militant tactics against policemen.", "ref": "Confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader and 13 others..

'I'm looking forward to my concerts at the Sydney Opera House in May, but I was extremely dismayed to learn from my friends at PETA Australia that The Just Group refuse to modernise and drop angora wool from their clothing lines', Morrissey writes. 'By selling angora wool, you're sending the message to millions of shoppers that your company condone the barbaric abuse and slaughter of rabbits and are willing to perpetuate it.' Refusal: The Just Group, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial furStance: The retailer has previously issued a statement on the controversy, simply saying: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group'The singer, 55, added that he would post petitions for concertgoers to sign at information booths throughout the Opera House if the company did not reverse their decision.Globally, major fashion chains including Zara, H&M, Marks & Spencer, and Gap have all pledged to not use the fur in recent years after PETA outed the heartbreaking conditions of angora rabbits.The organisation revealed the treatment of rabbits on angora farms in China, where workers rip the fur from live rabbits' skin. PETA alleges that the rabbits 'scream in pain' during the process.The Just Group are yet to respond to Daily Mail Australia's request for comment, however a spokesperson has previously responded to PETA with the statement: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group.'In February, Morrissey made headline when he ordered all food and bar outlets linked to the Opera House's Concert Hall remove meat products from their menus for the duration of his residency.Additionally, the former Smiths singer, who has been a non-meat eater since the age of 11, ordered that only vegetarian food be served backstage at the venue.Protest: Morrissey, 55, pledged to set up petition booths for attendees at his Sydney concerts to sign if The Just Group do not complyThe  Irish-born star, who says he sees 'no difference' between eating animals and paedophilia, they are both rape, violence, murder, -  will take to the stage during the festival of light and music on the 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May.Morrissey has never been shy about his views on meat eaters and has categorically said 'If I'm introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away.'He briefly walked off-stage at Coachella in 2009, complaining about the smell from the nearby food concession area, saying 'The smell of burning animals is making me sick'.Last month he banned burgers and hot dogs from Belfast's the Odyssey Arena for his performance.And he recently ditched a scheduled concert in Iceland when the venue refused to grant his no meat requests the night of his gig.In concert: The Irish-born musician has also banned the sale of meat products at the Opera House for the duration of his residency for the Vivid festival in MayLast year, during a Q&A session on his fan site, True To You, he replied to a groupie's question saying: 'I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia...'Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you \"Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life,\" well, I doubt if you'd want to exchange phone numbers.' In another post, he wrote of TV chef Jamie Oliver: 'If Jamie 'Orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why doesn't he stick one of his children in a microwave?'The animal activist is equally known for his outspoken political views and hatred of the British monarchy.He once said in an outspoken interview in 1984 of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: 'She is only one person. She can be destroyed. It is the only remedy for this country at the moment.'British police responded by searching Morrissey's home and carrying out an official investigation.

Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Odendaal, who uploaded the pictures to her Instagram, said: 'We were on holiday. We go to the park a couple of times every year but this is the first time something like this has happened.'It was on the third day of a five day trip in the morning that we saw the buffalo. We were on the h3 road, going from the from Malelane satellite camp  towards Skukuza camp.'It started when we saw two male lions just past abridge heading towards a waterhole.'They got a drink of water and then slept under bushes on our left hand side and then we spotted the buffalo on our right side. 'The wind was in the lions favour, they jumped up in unison and walked fast over the road towards the buffalo.They looked really hungry and needed food, that's when the action started.'The lions stalked the buffalo before one jumped on its back. That lion held on for almost 30 minutes until the buffalo ran towards the cars. It's horn punctured a car wheel which gave the lion a fright.'The other male lion got thrown through the air but came back and also started biting the buffalo by its tail. We could smell the blood.  Life or death: Miss Odendaal, a teacher from the village of Lothair, captured these images of the beasts fighting with one-another before the buffalo crashed into her vehicleExplain that to the insurers! A fully grown buffalo can weigh up to 1,750lbs - about half the weight of a VW Golf - and stands six foot tall, meaning it left quite a dent in the car's door'Just before the lions could bring the buffalo down it punctured the car wheel and then ran into our car taking the mirror off.'I was in the car with my sister and her two children, one-year-old Hendri, and Lisa who is four.'The children started crying after the buffalo hit the car but we told them to sit really still.'I hoped that the lions would manage to bring the buffalo down in order to feed. They need to eat as well but other people were screaming for the poor buffalo. 'I gained even more respect for lions watching this with my own eyes the perseverance it takes to try and bring it down and the buffalo really hurt them running through the bush with them.'She also revealed that the unlucky buffalo caused around \u00a311,000 worth of damage to the car. Nadav Ossendryver, the founder of Latest Sightings, a website that tracks animals in the Kruger park, uploaded the pictures last week and said it was something he'd never seen before.Ms Odendaal's friends also joked about the close-shave on Facebook, with Jeremy Hallett quipping: 'Explain that to your insurance!'The Kruger National Park spans 7,500 square miles of territory in the north east of South Africa along its border with Mozambique, making it one of the largest game reserves in Africa.One of a kind: When Miss Odendaal's images were uploaded to website for spotting wildlife in the Kruger park, it's founder said he had never seen anything like it beforeThe park is home to more 12,000 elephants, 1,000 leopards, 2,800 lions, and 27,000 African Buffalo, with the climate ranging from savanna scrubland in the south, to tropical in the north.The buffalo that call the park home can reach heights of six foot and weigh around 1,750lbs - or around half the weight of a VW Golf.The male African lion, pictured here, reaches an adult weight of just under 500lbs, making it the second largest big cat after the tiger, but still nowhere near as large as the buffalo.", "ref": "Rone Odendaal, 24, took pictures of two lions hunting an elderly Buffalo..

In its desperation the animal ran straight into the side Ms Odendaal's car.", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 3.0, "accuracy": 3.0, "coverage": 3.0, "coherence": 4.0, "bert_score_p":

Is this Britain's most expensive handbag? A sade-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag embellished with rubies has gone on sale for \u00a3140,000So what do you get for your money? The made-to-measure pink croc Hermes Birkin bag comes embellished with rubies.The rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store and experts say it's an extremely good investment.Fanny Moizant, Vestiaire Collective's Brand Communications Director and Head of UK, said: 'Hermes Birkin bags have come to symbolise the epitome of quality, the materials and the impeccable French craftsmanship are second to none. 'The brand has a strong heritage with a controlled supply, which makes it highly desirable for stylish women. This aspirational identity has developed into a strong social status symbol. The limited supply and production of rare colours and skin have made these bags must-have collectors items resulting in an increased value over time,  unlike cars, which are known to depreciate in value after leaving the showroom.' With the same amount of money that the handbag costs, you could splash out on an Aston Martin DB9 VolanteWhilst they don't own the exact same bag, Kim Kardashian, left, and Heidi Klum, right, are both the proud owners of pink Hermes Birkin bagsHermes is one of the most coveted handbags of all time, but with a price tag of around \u00a38,000 the Herm\u00e9s Birkin bag isn't quite within every fashionista's price range (unless you're Victoria Beckham whose collection is worth a reported \u00a31.5m).Prestigious luggage and accessories firm Herm\u00e9s, who count many of the world's wealthiest women as fans, is known for luxury leather accessories.Renowned for its immaculate finish and top quality materials, Herm\u00e8s claims never to use any assembly lines with one craftsperson making a single handbag at a time, hand-stitching individual pieces to create the finished product.The brand is rich in history, and some of its bestselling bags have intriguing stories behind them.The iconic Kelly bag, one of Hermes most popular styles, was originally known as the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches when it was developed by Hermes in 1935.In 1956, a photo of Grace Kelly, who had become the new Princess of Monaco, was pictured carrying the Sac \u00e0 d\u00e9p\u00eaches to hide her pregnancy.Photographs were sent all over the world and put on the cover of Life magazine. As a result, the bag became known as the Kelly and has been hugely popular ever since.Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian are big fans of Hermes ... handbag Victoria reportedly owns a collection worth \u00a31.5mThe Birkin has similarly romantic roots, conceived as it was in honour of French star Jane Birkin.The Birkin was allegedly created after the company's CEO Jean Louis Dumas sat next to the actress on a Paris to London flight.Birkin had been discussing her difficulty in finding a leather weekend bag, explaining her ideal.Shortly after, in 1984, the bag she described arrived at her flat with a note from Dumas. Although nowadays the bag can be made to order, the design is still one of the most recognised in the fashion industry.And Victoria Beckham isn't the only celebrity Birkin fan.British-born author Barbara Taylor Bradford owns an impressive 24 and heiress Tamara Ecclestone has specially built cupboards to house her \u00a3100,000 collection.Katie Holmes, Julia Roberts, Hilary Duff and Kelly Brook are also fans while Jane Birkin, the inspiration behind the roomy leather must-have has said she covers her 'b***** heavy' Birkin with stickers to disguise the fact she's carrying a 'snobbish' bag.", "ref": "Rare tote is so exclusive that it can't even be brought in store..

There were so many armed police with machine guns, it was like the Falklands War all over again.'Car: Mr Arwani was found dead last week in this Volkswagen Passat on a street in WembleyCooper was remanded in custody by a judge yesterday ahead of his appearance at the Old Bailey this week.Last night, Mr Arwani's family thanked the local community 'for the outpouring of support during this extremely difficult time'.In a statement released through Scotland Yard, his son Murhaf said: 'We are touched to learn how many people my father helped, advised and inspired in his short life.'If anyone has any additional information that can help with the investigation, we urge you to please come forward and speak to the Metropolitan Police.'Your co-operation will help us close this painful page and begin to move on with our lives, in the knowledge that the person who took away our father will be brought to justice and duly punished for this heinous crime.'Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.", "ref": "Police search An Noor Community Centre in West London and Burnell Mitchell's home in Wembley ..

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was movingSimilar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like thisTimeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journeyInside: The above diagram shows the inside the police vanPictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security cameraAccording to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop.The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning.It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new informationPolice Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information.  He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate.Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC.The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago.A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'.However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help.But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12.In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow.'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon.Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stopThese are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stopJung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital.'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'.However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary ClintonThe assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family.'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston.Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information.'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in BaltimoreFreddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west sideNicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor.The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling.He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market.He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'.Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler.According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured.Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives.Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning.In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014.'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,\" Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun.'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They're very unlikely to go on to higher education. They're less likely to be able to hold a job', she said.'They're less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are 'nice' or not.'Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received.Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories.The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans.More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed.The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.", "ref": "Medical examiner 'found Freddie Gray's catastrophic head injury was consistent with bolt in the back door of the Police van' Police report suggests he was standing and fell head first into the door..

We don't know what is going on. Before the trek she said, \"Don't expect to hear from me necessarily until I get back.\" We are doing what we can.'The 20-year-old worked as a waitress to save money for her trip to Asia, where she worked at a farm in Nepal before going trekking. She was due to continue to India for a yoga course in June.

He is still listed as missing. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.'A couple from Carshalton in Surrey, Chloe Pincho and Brennan White, were trekking up Mount Everest at the time of the disaster and their whereabouts is now unknown.The parents of Matt Carapiet, 23, from Kent made an online appeal for him to contact them after he went missing in the wake of the crisis.Abroad: Martin Gattuso, left, lives in Nepal where he is a Buddhist monk; Jake Whyles, right, was visiting the mountainous country41-year-old Scottish woman Seobhan McGuigan and Jack Young, 21, from Lincolnshire are two more Britons to be on the list of the missing.59-year-old Janet Brownlie and Jack Kilpatrick, 24, from Teddington in Middlesex, are also out of contact.Judith Ridgewell, who is in her 40s and from Cornwall, has gone missing on her travels, and Jake Whyles, 24, from Lincolnshire is also out of contact.Gary Williams, 52, from Plymouth was last heard from on Friday night, when he sent an email to his relatives while trekking in Nepal.Norah Arscott, 77, from Somerset; Philip Green, 30, from London; and Shaun Bailey, 27, from Stoke-on-Trent are all reported as missing.24-year-old Naomi Everett, from Cheshire, is also on the Red Cross list of the missing, along with Lloyd Davies, 22, from Beckenham.Rescue: The scene at Everest base camp after the earthquake killed a number of climbers on the world's tallest mountainCarnage: A building in Bhaktapur, near Kathmandu, which was almost completely destroyed by the natural disasterAnother missing teenager is Annette Burd, 18, from Leicestershire, while relatives of Tom Southgate, 23, are anxiously waiting to hear from him in Nottingham and Heather Stretton, 47, from Lincolnshire is also missing.Richard Jones, 33, from Worcestershire went missing while trekking in Annapurna; Victoria Barkas, 34, and Ian Norquay, from Sussex have also been in the area.Also missing are two Britons who have moved to South Asia - Simon Charlesworth, 49, and Buddhist monk Martin Gattuso, 38, originally from Norfolk.Around 10 British-born expats living in Australia are currently being sought. A number of other British travellers were initially reported missing but were able to contact their families within a day or two.These included Sebastian Lovera, 22, who was hiking to Mount Everest at the time of the earthquake but has now returned to Kathmandu to help victims of the disaster.Teenager Michael Walker, a gap-year student from Exeter who had been trekking in the region, was found safe and well today after his parents and former teachers issued an appeal.Abdulla Dahab, 21, from London was also located for the first time today, allaying the fears of his family who had not heard from him as he set off on a mountain climb at the time the earthquake hit.", "ref": "Susannah Ross, 20, went on a trek last week and has not been heard from since the earthquake on Saturday..

When the plane landed, SkyWest initially claimed that the aircraft landed 'out of an abundance of caution' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane.Late on Wednesday, the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that 'a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight'.Scroll down for video Emergency responders came onboard SkyWest Flight 5622 after it made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday following a reported loss of cabin pressureMary Cunningham, a nurse, who was on board the flight assisted one passenger who passed out, getting her oxygen. She said that the plane did not land because of just one person's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell Passenger Frank Angelo said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane 'nosedived' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes'You could feel something in the air, something just wasn't right,' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes. Passenger Larry Johnson, right, said: 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment'Emergency nurse, Mary Cunningham, said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint.'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great,' said Cunningham to NBC Connecticut.Initially, reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight, leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure. When the plane landed at 11.40am, the FAA issued a statement saying the crew 'reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency', shortly before landing in Buffalo.However, in a second statement the FAA put out on Wednesday afternoon, there was no mention of a 'pressurization' issue.When contacted by the LA Times to explain this, a spokesperson for the FAA would not say why the change was made.However, an official with knowledge of the incident told the LA Times that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing 'rapid depressurization.'On landing this was declared untrue and SkyWest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight.SkyWest spokeswoman Marissa Snow said: 'There were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent, but I can't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.'SkyWest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft.Nose dive: Emergency vehicles surround a SkyWest Airlines plane, operating as United Express, that made an emergency landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport on WednesdayFlight 5622, from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in BuffaloPassenger, Dave Barkley, 46, told the LA Times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious.Suddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over Detroit.'They said there was a pressure problem with the plane,' he said. 'There was no door flying open or anything like that. It was something very gradual.'Barkley said that while the passengers were calm, he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made.'The way SkyWest is reporting it is that someone got sick, and they had to land,' he told the LA Times. 'But the way we understand it, they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane.' A nurse flying on the Embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out.It was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks. 'The passenger was lethargic. She was responding but her color was off. She didn't look good. We got her some oxygen. She was much more alert after getting the oxygen,' the nurse, Mary Cunningham, tells NBC Connecticut. Cunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better. It was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out, as well.Then Cunningham, herself, took a turn.Passengers arriving at Buffalo Niagara International Airport react to the group of media gathered to report on a SkyWest Airlines plane that made an emergency landing after one passenger aboard Flight 5622 lost consciousness and the pilots rapidly descended 'out of an abundance of caution.'Courtesy WKBW  'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great.' Passenger Larry Johnson said, 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment.'While another passenger said, 'you could just feel something in the air, something just wasn't quite right.'For nearly eight minutes, the plane descended at a very steep incline, dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute, while flying over Lake Erie, flight tracking service FlightAware said. The flight originated in Chicago and had been bound for Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. It landed at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. SkyWest Inc., which is based in St. George, Utah, said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released.An additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing, but none required treatment outside the airport, airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer said.'Anyone who said they didn't feel well was treated at the gate,' he said. 'We want to understand the circumstances and what SkyWest knows before we decide what, if any, action we would take,' said Kelly Nantel, spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board. Snow said the plane's oxygen masks did not release. According to WKBW, one passenger said the plane 'nosedived' and crew told fliers that there was a loss of cabin pressure, but that turned out not to be true. SkyWest has 29 Embraer 175s in its fleet. The aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants. In a statement, the FAA said: 'SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 aircraft, landed safely at Buffalo International Airport at 11.40am after the crew declared an emergency.  'The FAA will investigate.'The Skywest flight made an emergency landing at Buffalo Airport (pictured) on its journey from Chicago O'Hare to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut", "ref": "Skywest Inc, based in St. george, Utah, said the jet landed safely and three passengers received medical attention before being released ..

But, a professional to his core, Benaud kept on filing. He loved cricket, and he loved conveying his love, by visual means or verbal.That much was evident during his playing days. He won 63 Test caps between January 1952 and February 1964, collecting 248 wickets with his leg-spin (at a very good average of 27) and scoring 2,201 runs at 24. But it was the style as much as the stats.It was often an understated era, typified by Jim Laker's steadfast refusal to celebrate any of the 19 wickets he took against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956 (Benaud c Statham b Laker 0; Benaud b Laker 18).Benaud did his best to change all that. Sport was fun, emotional and human: if he got a wicket, he'd do more than hitch his trousers up, Laker-style. He'd whoop and skip and jump: take a look on YouTube at him enjoying Bob Simpson's slip catch at Old Trafford in 1961, where his leg-breaks spirited Australia to a come-from-behind win.These days players go further than that. But Benaud was their spiritual forefather.He loved not just cricket, but cricketers too. Not everyone was enamoured by his involvement in Kerry Packer's rebellious World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. But WSC eventually forced the Establishment's hand. Cricketers were soon paid a living wage, not the honorariums they had previously endured. Benaud's involvement and influence were central to that.It was as a TV commentator that Benaud came into his own. When Wisden asked him in 2003 to dispense some advice to aspiring broadcasters, he suggested: 'Put your brain into gear before opening your mouth.'That style \u2013 laconic, considered, dry \u2013 would become his hallmark, together with an unfailing greeting: 'Good morning, everyone.' When Benaud welcomed viewers, they were able to relax: the cricket was about to begin.There were times when you might have longed for him to express himself more trenchantly, to air his opinions more clearly. Surely, you wondered, he must have felt strongly about subjects other than the front-foot no-ball law.But it was not his style \u2013 and he remained true to himself. 'Above all,' he told Wisden, 'when commentating, don't take yourself too seriously, and have fun.'Benaud was Australia captain and  the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in TestsAfter his playing career, Benaud forged an incredibly successful career as a cricket commentatorBenaud (right) in discussion with England's Michael Vaughan ahead of a Test match in 2004That last tip has been cheerfully taken on board by the current generation of Channel Nine commentators in Australia. And if they have been less adept at putting their brains into gear before opening their mouths, then that also reflects the almost impossibly high standards set by Benaud himself. His successors were always going to pale by comparison.Behind it all was a quiet, imposing strength. The first time I met him, Benaud almost broke my fingers with his handshake. As a friend noted: 'You don't get to captain Australia with a limp wrist.'Good night, everyone.", "ref": "Richie Benaud has died at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer..

The only other player to have done so is AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf, who lifted the famous piece of silverware for Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan.  Xabi Alonso could become only the second player to win the Champions League with three different teamsAlonso in action during Bayern Munich's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final defeat against Porto last weekIt is quite an achievement, and one that the Spanish maestro recently admitted to thinking about.  'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso told The Telegraph. 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' he added. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over Atletico Madrid.Alonso celebrates winning Europe's top club prize in his first season with Liverpool in 2005Alonso (on the ground) scored the equaliser for Liverpool during the 3-3 against AC Milan before the English club won 3-2 on penaltiesJose Bosingwa - Porto (2004), Chelsea (2012)Paulo Ferreira - Porto (2004), Chelsea (2012)Cristiano Ronaldo - United (2008) Madrid (2014)Deco - Porto (2004), Barcelona (2006)Thiago Motta - Barcelona (2006), Inter Milan (2010)Owen Hargreaves - Bayern Munich (2001), United (2008)Paulo Sousa - Juventus (1996), Dortmund (1997)Vladimir Jugovic - Red Star Belgrade (1991), Juventus (1996)Didier Deschamps - Marseille (1993), Juventus (1996)Edwin van der Sar - Ajax (1995), United (2008)Christian Panucci - Milan (1994), Madrid (1998)Marcel Desailly - Marseille (1993), Milan (1994)Dejan Savicevic - Red Star Belgrade (1991), Milan (1994)Ronald Koeman - PSV (1988), Barcelona (1992)Miodrag Belodedici - Steaua Bucurest (1986), Red Star Belgrade (1991)Jimmy Rimmer - United (1968), Villa (1982)Saul Malatrasi - Inter Milan (1965), Milan (1969) Seedorf won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with Ajax, 1998 with Madrid and twice with Milan, in 2003 and 2007.At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. Thiago Motta could also equal Seedorf's record if he manages to earn a Champions League medal with Paris Saint-Germain, but the 32-year-old midfielder has his work cut-out as the Ligue 1 side trail to a 3-1 aggregate scoreline against Barcelona. Names to have retired with two Champions League medals while at two different teams include the likes of Deco with Porto (2004) and Barcelona (2006) and former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar who had been part of the 1995 Ajax squad before holding the trophy once again with the Red Devils.  Midfielder Thiago Motta could would equal Seedorf's record if he were to win the Champions League with PSGThe Spaniard was suspended for Real Madrid's Champions League final victory against Atletico last year Clarence Seedorf (centre) won four Champions League with three clubs, including two with AC MilanThe Dutch midfielder celebrates with the famous trophy after Madrid's victory against Juventus in 1998", "ref": "Xabi Alonso won uefa Champions League with Liverpool and Real Madrid ..

Confusing processes were also identified as a major deterrent to sending an item back for 22 per cent.The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer. Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items.Amongst the most commonly unreturned items were women's dresses, shoes and trousers, which occupied the top three spots.Then came women's shirts or blouses, women's jeans, electrical equipment, women's jackets, homeware, jewellery and women's underwear, according to the One Poll survey of 2,000 people.Most people say it is simply too inconvenient to return the item, or not worth the costDoddle has introduced changing rooms to a number of its stores to make trying and returning online purchases, easier. The facilities allow customers to collect, try and return, online unsuitable items.Chief executive Tim Robinson said: 'Customers have become so frustrated with the processes for returning online purchases that they would rather forgo the cash from the refund, to skip the lengthy and inconvenient queues associated with the task.'But it doesn't have to be this way. We launched Doddle so that customers can collect and return online purchases in less than two minutes. It's Doddle's mission to redefine online shopping by making collecting and returning parcels easy - and save customers' time and money.'", "ref": "Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items ..

He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policemanSheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions.In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff.'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player.'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues.'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park.'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.'His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending.He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem.The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.'O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions.'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.'After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013.'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.'However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling.'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added.Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court.McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.", "ref": "Paul mcgowan avoided a jail sentence after police attack..

There are no boat bumps.'The company are developing larger aircraft that they hope will be able to carry up to 120 passengers", "ref": "Two prototype aircraft were tested off the coast of Haikou, in the Hainan Province of China..

The family's lawyer Neil Sheldon told Mrs Cappuccini's inquest that she was left struggling to breathe for 90 minutes without being given sufficient oxygen. He also questioned why the teacher did not receive a blood transfusion earlier and suggested there could be an issue with maternity ward staff overruling women's wishes for their birth plans.The inquest was halted in February last year so evidence could be referred to prosecutors to allow them to consider bringing criminal charges.Mr Sheldon said at the time: 'The family has not entered into the process for any other reason than to have questions answered. They are not trying to have anyone convicted, but they do want to find out what happened and why.' Neighbours said Dr Azeez then moved away in September after splitting up with his wife \u2013 who is also a doctor \u2013 and selling his house in Tunbridge Wells. He had attended school and completed his medical training in Lahore, Pakistan, before coming to Britain.The father of two is also currently suspended from the General Medical Council's register of doctors.Tragedy: Frances Cappuccini, 30, died from a haemorrhage hours after giving birth to her second son Giacomo on October 9, 2012. Two doctors have been charged with  manslaughter by gross negligenceHeartbreak: Lawyers said Mrs Cappuccini and her husband Tom, 33, from West Malling, Kent had decided on birth by planned caesarean - but were allegedly persuaded to try a natural birth insteadA spokesman for Kent Police said: 'An international warrant has been issued for the arrest of Dr Azeez, who is believed to have left the country and returned to Pakistan.'Dr Cornish, of Bromley in South London, is originally from South Africa where he trained at the University of Cape Town in the 1970s.Delays: An inquest into Mrs Cappuccini's death was due to be heard in February last year but was postponed while Kent police investigated the possibility of criminal charges.Mrs Cappuccini, who was affectionately called 'Mrs Coffee' by her pupils, taught five and six-year-olds at Offham Primary School, near West Malling, also in Kent.Her positive attitude has been praised by headteacher Phillip Hunter, who described her as a 'bubbly and enthusiastic person' and paid tribute to her as a 'brilliant teacher'.Lawyers for the family said yesterday that they did not want to comment on the decision to charge the two anaesthetists.Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust \u2013 which was criticised in 2007 after 90 patients died in an outbreak of superbug C difficile \u2013 said it could not make a statement for legal reasons.The first hearing in the case will take place at Sevenoaks magistrates' court on Friday next week.Mrs Cappuccini managed to spend time with her new son who was born weighing 7lb 15oz and nurse him before she died.She and her husband Tom had a son Luca, who was three at the time of her death.Mrs Cappuccini had taught at Offham Primary School in West Malling for nine years after training there.Colleagues and friends described her as 'bubbly and enthusiastic' and a 'brilliant teacher'.Phillip Hunter, head of the 200 pupil primary school, said at the time of her death: 'Frankie did her teacher training with us nine years ago and stayed on afterwards.'She was a bubbly, enthusiastic and positive person and on top of all a brilliant teacher.'She was a friend and a colleague to us. The community is shattered to learn of her death.'The Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said today it was unable to comment on the case.Workplace: Mrs Cappuccini had taught at Offham Primary School in West Malling for nine years before she dfedTribute: The children affectionately called her 'Mrs Coffee' and wrote their own messages after her deathDeath:  The teacher died at Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, pictured, almost three years agoSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.", "ref": "Frances Cappuccini died after giving birth to  son Giacomo in October 2012..

For example, one tagged #balancingact features six clips in total and includes a dog balancing a banana on its head followed by a skateboarder, and a woman balancing books on her head.Each video has a counter that shows how many clips are attached, and which clip in the sequence the viewer is currently watching.It also shows how many people have viewed the total project. Individual clips can be reported for inappropriate content, for example, by clicking the menu button in the top right-hand corner of a clip and clicking the red whistle icon. Elsewhere, videos can be shared on social networks, over email and in messaging apps.It doesn't reveal what the maximum number of clips in a project is, but each clip can be no longer than 10 seconds.

'Our hunch was that if you could make videos collaboratively, the creative process would be more fun and the final product would be cooler. 'Today, we are introducing Riff, a creative tool to make videos with friends.' Once a friend adds a clip to a video, a user's friend's friends will also be shown the video in Riff and will be able to add to it.'The potential pool of creative collaborators can grow exponentially from there, so a short video can become an inventive project between circles of friends that you can share to Facebook, or anywhere on the internet, at any time,' continued the blog post. If it is a hoax then it is an elaborate one that Facebook has continued for longer than April Fool's Day.", "ref": "Riff was developed in london and is available on Android and ios ..

She died aged 91The 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' neon sign, here outlined in pink lightbulbs in honor of breast cancer awareness month, became a major tourist attraction'It's the most recognizable icon in the world,' said Danielle Kelly, executive director of The Neon Museum in Las Vegas, where the signs of Sin City's past are retired and on display.The welcome sign's design, which doesn't have a copyright owner, has become a fixture on travel tchotchkes from Vegas and everywhere else, Kelly said.She has a T-shirt from San Francisco with that city's name swapped in for Las Vegas in front of the sign's recognizable shape, she said.'The fact that everyone loves that sign and its design after all these years is a testament to Betty's talents,' Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak said.'There is probably no bigger Las Vegas icon than that sign.'In 2009, the sign was added to the National Register of Historic Places.Kelly called Willis' designs dazzling and said her personality was akin to a strong, fast-talking female lead in movies like 'His Girl Friday.''A little salty, a little irreverent,' Kelly said with fondness. 'I thought she was a classic broad.'Willis, born in 1923 in the small town of Overton northeast of Las Vegas, worked as a commercial artist in Los Angeles before returning to Las Vegas, where she worked for sign companies and designed the famous diamond-shaped beacon of flashing lights.The sign has become such a popular photo backdrop that a parking lot for cars and tour buses in the middle of the street was expanded in 2012.Willis also designed neon signs for the Moulin Rouge casino and Blue Angel motel in Las Vegas.The iconic neon sign has welcomed tourists to Las Vegas since 1959.

The theatre director intended to retire to the property Now the council has won the right to force Miss Walford to use the equity in the house, where she intended to retire, for care home fees, which can be up to \u00a3600 a week.Solicitors warned that the case could pave the way for relatives across the country to be liable for their parents' care.Charlotte Kelly, an associate at Worcestershire legal firm Kerwoods, said: 'This was a very significant judgment and one which will affect many in similar situations.'When her mother Mary Walford, now aged 100, was admitted into care in 2006, the council agreed that the house in Stourport-on-Severn should not be taken into account during means testing.But in 2013 they reversed their decision and said that Miss Walford would need to begin contributing towards bills. Frustrated by the U-turn, Miss Walford became embroiled in a legal battle with the council which was taken to the High Court in January 2014.Miss Walford said she had always planned to retire to her mother's house in Stourpour-upon-Severn (above) There, a judge ruled that her home should not be taken into account when means testing was carried out on her mother's finances. In his ruling, Justice Supperstone concluded: 'A \"home\" is a place to which a person has a degree of attachment both physical and emotional.'But the council took the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing that although the property may be her home, it was not at the time her mother was taken into care. Yesterday Miss Walford said: 'I am now in a position where I will almost certainly have to sell my home to pay for my mother's care bills which will leave me homeless. I have no energy or money left to fight them.'Sunnydene has been in the family for decades and was built by her grandmother's aunt in the mid-1800s. Miss Walford's car is parked in the drive, her belongings fill the bedrooms and she has an office where she carries out her work.Yet she is often posted across the globe and, when working on national productions, needs to be based in London. As a result Miss Walford rents a bedsit owned by a friend in the centre of the capital.Miss Walford, who has never married and has no children, said: 'Sunnydene is my home. I have lived there since I was 13.'I pay council tax, the electricity bills and have spent \u00a342,000 renovating it. It was always my intention to retire in the house.A judge at the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Worcestershire County Council in January. Earlier the High Court (above) had sided with the Walford family 'It is quite simply my home and it is going to be sold from underneath me. God knows how many other people will face the same heartache following this ruling.' In the Court of Appeal hearing on December 9 last year, her barrister Fraser Campbell argued that the only reason his client did not permanently live at Sunnydene was because her work ties her to London.By saying that the house would have been Miss Walford's residence had she not worked in London, the council was discouraging people over the age of 60 from working, Mr Campbell argued.Despite the submissions, two out of three judges ruled in the council's favour. Lord Justice McCombe, who rejected the council's appeal, said he saw 'no reason' to assess whether the property was Miss Walford's home based on a 'historic' date.Yesterday a Worcestershire Council spokesman said: 'This was an important legal challenge and we are pleased that the Court of Appeal ruled in our favour.'There are ever increasing demands being made on the public purse and it is important that decisions about how public money is used to support individuals are fair and consistent.'", "ref": "Glen Walford, 75, grew up In her parents' house In stourport-upon-severn .. The theatre director's mother Mary was forced to move into care In 2006.. Worcestershire County Council tried to sell the house to pay for her care.. But Miss Walford fought them, claiming the property was hers to retire to.. High Court sided with the Walford family who were allowed to keep house.. But its decision was overturned In the Court of Appeal earlier this year.. Now the Council will decide whether or not to put the house on the market.", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 7.0, "accuracy": 7.0, "coverage": 7.0, "coherence": 7.0, "bert_score_p":

His left hand is still in a cast from the attack. South Korean law requires the trial to start within 14 days, and there is a possibility that it could start as early as next week, according to an official at the Seoul Central District Court, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. He said it was too early to comment on the potential penalties Kim could face.US Ambassador Mark Lippert was pictured with five bodyguards on Wednesday, following the attack that left his arm in a castLippert required 80 stitches to close up the wounds on his hand, arm and face that he sustained from the anti-US activistVictim: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, pictured on March 10, was allegedly slashed by Kim KI-jong at a breakfast forum on March 5Charged: South Korean maverick political activist Kim Ki-Jong, who faces possible attempted murder charges after slashing US Ambassador Mark Lippert, as he leaves a police station for a court in Seoul on March 6Alleged attacker: Kim Ki-jong is pictured being arrested at the site where U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert was attacked on March 5, 2015 in Seoul, South KoreaProsecutors have also been investigating whether Kim violated a controversial law that bans praise or assistance for North Korea. The court official said it was possible prosecutors may add such charges against Kim during the trial.Police say Kim attacked Ambassador Mark Lippert with a knife during a breakfast forum on March 5. He suffered deep gashes on his face and arm and was treated at a Seoul hospital for five days.Lippert, 42, was bleeding from deep wounds to his face and wrist but was able to walk after the attack.Doctors said later his condition was stable after 'very successful' surgery that required 80 stitches in his face as the White House expressed optimism for his quick return to his duties.Police say Kim chose Lippert as a target to highlight his opposition to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills. North Korea has angrily reacted to the drills, calling them an invasion rehearsal.Anti-U.S. activists such as Kim have long blamed the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in the South as a deterrent to the North for the continuing split of the Korean Peninsula.In 2010, Kim tried to attack the Japanese ambassador to South Korea by throwing a piece of concrete and was given a suspended jail term, according to police.After the attack: Kim Ki-jong during his arrest after he allegedly attacked Ambassador Lippert with a razor blade to protest the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South KoreaWatchdog Organization: Kim ji-Jong reportedly identified himself as a representative for a watchdog organization of the disputed island Dokdo/Takeshima and was arrested immediately on site", "ref": "Kim Ki-jong, 55, was indicted on charges of attempted murder for allegedly slashing U.S..

Hostilities are likely to resume before the day is out: a brief, peaceful window has been delicately negotiated following a special request from the U.N. -- but it won't last long.Unicef hopes there will be just enough time to deliver vital food and supplies, helping to ease the country's worsening humanitarian crisis.More than 100,000 Yemeni civilians have fled their homes since fighting began, and OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, estimates that 15.9 million people here are in need of assistance.The main terminal at El Rahaba Airport is under the control of the Houthi rebels. We can't get near it for fear of provoking trouble.But there is plenty to be done out on the tarmac. Within minutes of touching down, a small army of aid workers is busy unloading huge mounds of much-needed provisions.Gusts of wind blow dust across the runway, as crates and pallets of emergency nutrition and medical equipment pile up rapidly beside the plane.Unicef's team has overcome more than one hurdle just getting it this far -- now they'll have to work out how to distribute it to those most in need in a country paralyzed by a lack of resources.Even before Saudi airstrikes, most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs, according to the United Nations.As they work, an Air India plane is taxiing away from the terminal. Thousands have fled the country on evacuation flights in recent weeks as the situation in Yemen has deteriorated.But for those who have nowhere else to go and no chance of a flight out, mercy missions by Unicef and other NGOs like it are the only hope.READ MORE: 'A window into hell' - desperate Yemenis flee by boatREAD MORE: Civilian catastrophe looming in YemenREAD MORE: Yemen crisis - how you can helpBryony Jones contributed to this report", "ref": "Almost 16 million people in Yemen are in need of Humanitarian aid, according to U.N. planeload of aid supplies including food and medicine was flown in to Sanaa on Tuesday..

It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier.Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in BitcoinransomThe only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe.'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could.'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.'Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort'The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day.Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan.It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier.CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked.Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads.According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency.After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom.As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach.'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier.Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S.Similar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier.Police in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.", "ref": "Tewksbury Police Department was attacked by criminals who infected their network with  malware program called cryptolocker..

As the only Gulf national in the CNN team, I am expected to be familiar with camel racing, an ancient tradition in the region. But despite my attempts to dress in a kandora, a UAE national dress, my modern outlook on life means I am a total outsider in this world.A cheerful farm owner leads us inside the majlis -- meeting area -- where the camel owners are gathering. The wide space of the majlis feels like an ornate theater.The camel owners are sitting on the floor, eating the a'aish, a traditional Arabic dish of fish and rice, laid out in front of them. The conversation is loud and exciting.We take our place on the floor and slowly, the world of camel racing begins to open up to us.The conversation is all about camels; the best breeds, famous old champions, training methods, bad losers and potential winners.Over Arabic coffee and dates I am told that remote controlled robots have replaced children as camel jockeys -- this primal sport is moving with the times.Once lunch is over, we head to the track for the racing to begin. There will be 14 races through the afternoon. And in addition to the honor and prestige, the camels are racing for thousands of dollars in prize money and fancy new cars for their owners.It's surprising how spectacular camel racing can be. Compared to the grace of thoroughbred racehorses, camels are indeed ungainly creatures.But 20 of these huge beasts pounding around a track in the desert is really a sight to behold, their hooves throwing up a cloud of dust in their wake. Their owners hang out of their four-by-fours, shouting encouragement while trying to keep up with their charges. It is oddly beautiful.The winning camels are paraded with pride, their heads and necks covered in bright golden saffron and their owners applauded for their efforts and rewarded with cash prizes.As we excitedly watch the final race draw to a close, the sun sets across the sky of this metropolis. Camel racing bears no relevance to the modernity embraced here, but this old-fashioned sport is equally as fascinating.", "ref": "Camel racing is a centuries-old tradition in the Gulf..

'It's not my job to talk when it is and when it's not, it will be soon enough.'I've been told this morning that we hope it will be concluded by the time we arrive here on Saturday, whether that's today or tomorrow I am not 100 per cent sure.'The Millers have vowed to fight the charge, hiring top QC Jim Sturman to defend them, but a three-point deduction is thought to be the likeliest punishment should they be found guilty.But Evans insists he does not know the strength of his club's defence and has not been involved.Rotherham drew 1-1 with Fulham on Wednesday night, leaving them four points above the relegation zone'I am not involved in the case, all I know is the chairman that has spent many hours heading the football club on this with a legal representative, I've not been involved in any of the meetings because it is not my department,' he added.'I have almost been kept at a distance.'You have to accept there's been an error. Certainly, knowing people inside this football club, no one means to make an error.'I don't want to cast judgement on people who make genuine mistakes. I have made enough of them. I have often said that in my career and I mean it.'", "ref": "Millers await verdict of three-man Football League disciplinary panel.. Manager Steve Evans expects decision before Norwich home game ..

{"i": "dc8bb8429f624c4cceea3caae72874acb85e69b3", "src": "I remember the day I stopped praying. It was the day after my little brother, Jimmy, died of cancer. He was 25. I was so angry at God.I was 27 at the time, and, like most young people I had stopped going to church. But, on that day -- that terrible day -- I desperately needed to understand why God took my brother. I called the nearest Catholic church, looking for a priest. A lady picked up the phone. \"Can I talk with Father?\" I asked.I wish I could say her answer was \"yes.\"Instead, she asked me if I was a member of that particular parish. \"Does it matter?\" I asked. (At the time I lived far from my home parish.) I don't remember how she responded, but the answer about my being able to see Father was clearly no.I don't know if all Catholic churches would have shut me out, but I figured, at the time, it was part of the long list of rules the Vatican required Catholic leaders to follow. I cried for a bit, then decided I would never ask God for anything. Clearly, his conduits on Earth did not have time for me -- a lifelong Catholic -- and sinner -- so why would he?Ever since, I've considered myself a lapsed Catholic.Until Pope Francis.There is something about Francis that's reawakened my faith. And it's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church. He still argues against things I passionately support, but I find myself -- like many other lapsed Catholics -- enthralled.Recently I had the pleasure of meeting one of the Pope's newly appointed cardinals. His name is Cardinal Gerald Lacroix. The 57-year-old presides at the Basilica Cathedral of Notre Dame in Quebec City.One of my first questions: What is it about Pope Francis?\"Every person is a mystery you know. ... But what's evident is this man is living with such freedom, such inner freedom. He's himself. He's in tune with the Lord,\" Lacroix  told me.\"Those close to him say he's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily Mass, which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays. So that's almost three hours of prayer, preparation and silence before the Lord and the word of God. Wow, that really fine-tunes you to start off a day.\"Perhaps that's how the Pope stays humble. Why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled, women and those of other faiths. Why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in St. Peter's Square.All of this is appealing, but it's more than that. In my mind, it's his tone. When Pope Francis said, \"If a person is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" The comment took me aback. Homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the Vatican, yet Pope Francis uttered those welcoming words.Lacroix likened the Pope's approach to Jesus. \"Jesus didn't judge. Jesus did not come as a judge. He came as someone who preached and talked about the love of God.\"Those kinds of answers are so different in my experience, but I understand why more conservative Catholics worry. If the Pope does not judge, then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not?\"I hear that sometimes, too,\" Lacroix told me. \"I think Pope Francis is conservative in the right way. You have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation: that's the Gospel. You cannot reproach Pope Francis of not living the Gospel, or not preaching the truth of the Gospel.\"But isn't homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church?\"There is room for everyone. The door is open,\" Cardinal Lacroix insisted. \"Of course you know that the Catholic Church will never promote same sex marriage, but do we respect homosexual persons? Do we welcome them? Do we accompany them? Of course. But to respect the Church and its teaching, which is based on a long tradition and also the word of God, we will not go so far as to bless. But that doesn't mean we reject.\"That last sentiment -- \"that doesn't mean we reject.\" -- did it for me.I finally understood why Pope Francis reawakened my faith. I always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins. Like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish. Like not covering my head with a traditional veil at Easter. Like accidentally eating meat on Holy Friday. Like supporting the use of contraception.But as Lacroix told me, Jesus walked with sinners until the very end. He did not banish them to fires of hell, for He refused to give up on anyone.The Cardinal's last words to me: \"I'm trying to do my best on (the) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing. To see how we can today respond to those needs. I want people to see me, and the church, as an open heart to grow together. Not a church that's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose: the Lord Jesus and his Gospel.\"I can't wait to go church next Sunday. And, yes, I will bow my head and pray for forgiveness, and if I'm worthy, Christ's love.", "ref": "There is something about Pope Francis that's reawakened her faith, say cnn's carol costello..

Presumably on the one item of technology that wasn't currently taking a long soak. A Japanese woman got sweet revenge on her cheating boyfriend by giving his Apple collection a good washThe woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at \u00a3899 - a single soakingAs most of us know, a substantial splash is enough to send your gadget to glitch town, and so the dip this man's prized collection took is sure to prove irreversible damage.Particularly as the woman scorned took the trouble to give his iMac - which start at \u00a3899 - a single soaking. Just to make doubly sure the water damage was total. Even if he tries the recommended trick of leaving his gadgets in uncooked rice for 48 hours, we think all the rice in Japan couldn't dry this lot out. Clearly feeling little remorse for his sins and perhaps looking for sympathy, the unnamed man, also from Japan, Tweeted the pics to his account @foolishnessfly2.Retweeted more than 15,400 times, the response has been mixed.The hearts of Apple fans are mainly with the man, with the general consensus being that destroying a fellow's prized Apple collection is a bit harsh, even if he did cheat.This Twitterer fully supported the Japanese woman's actions, hailing it as 'the best revenge'@womenspeakup pointed out that the guy should be counting his lucky stars that it was his Apple and not his, er, banana that paid the price of cheating@jewlish spoke the words of women the world over with a 'you go, girl!'.Japanese @Allorcer90 took the time to explain the images to the English-speaking Twitterers who wondered what they were about, adding that it will make you think twice about cheatingWhile others agree that revenge is a dish best served in hot water.Although a lot of the comments were in Japanese (and the 'translate' button did little to help), the English-language responses were in favour of the woman's methods.@babysdoc hailed it as 'the best revenge', while @jewlish spoke the words of women the world over with a 'you go, girl!'.@womenspeakup pointed out that the guy should be counting his lucky stars that it was his Apple and not his, er, banana that paid the price of cheating, referring to Lorena Bobbit who cut off her husband's penis with a knife.Meanwhile, Japanese @Allorcer90 took the time to explain the images to the English-speaking Twitterers who wondered what they were about, adding, 'Haha makes you think twice about cheating on your significant other haha!'", "ref": "Japanese man pays for his cheating ways with his prized gadget collection..

Wannabe: 'Singer' Kristina Karo says she and Kunis were inseparable in first grade, but that the actress was jealous of her pet chicken 'Doggie' and stole the hen", "ref": "Mila Kunis' 'childhood friend from Ukraine' is suing her for $5,000..

He later resurfaced in Russia.Senior ministry official Anton Gerashchenko saidKalashnikov, 52, had knowledge of the 'Anti-Maidan' movement,which opposed pro-Western protests that ousted Yanukovich, suggesting this might be a motive for his alleged murder.The ministry had opened up a criminal case, he said.There were mass protests against Yanukovych last year in Kiev's Maidan Square'Without doubt the deceased knew a lot about who financedAnti-Maidan and in what way... He takes these secrets with himto the grave,' Gerashchenko said.On Thursday, meanwhile, a prominent Ukrainian journalist known for his pro-Russian views was shot dead  in Kiev by two masked gunmen.Oles Buzina, 45, was known for his pro-Russian opinionpieces published in Ukraine's Sevodnya daily newspaper, which is part of the media empire of Ukraine's richest businessman RinatAkhmetov.

Janet Brown was found naked, gagged with packing tape with her arms cuffed behind her back at the foot of the stairs of her family home in Radnage, near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire. Mrs Brown's two daughters Roxanne, 38, and Zara, 43, described their hother as a 'kind and loving nurse' claiming the horror of the crime 'stays with us every day. Janet Brown, pictured, was murdered at her family home 20 years ago by an unknown assailant Builders found Mrs Brown's naked body dumped at the bottom of the stairs of her home, picturedThe killer handcuffed Mrs Brown's hands behind her back hand gagged her with packing tape Mrs Brown's body was found on April 10, 1995.  According to the Brown sisters: 'She was attacked and killed in our family home - a place where we should all be safe.' They said they believed that their mother's murder had been pre-planned. On the night she was killed, Mrs Brown was home alone. Her two daughters and her son Benedict, then 21, had gone out. The following day, the 51-year-old nurse's naked body was found at the foot of the stairs by builders who had turned up to do work on the detached house in Sprigs Holly Lane, Radnage near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire.A post mortem revealed she died of head injuries, which detectives believe were probably inflicted by a blunt instrument like a crowbar.The motive remains unclear with police describing the circumstances of the crime as 'unusual', adding they 'keeping an open mind'.One possible line of inquiry was that it had been a break-in gone wrong, but while a window was broken and the burglar alarm triggered, nothing was taken from the home.There was also no evidence Mrs Brown had been sexually assaulted.Peter Beirne, right, of the cold case squad and Mrs Brown's daughters Roxanne, centre and Zara, right, appealed for information about the 'heinous' crime revealing forensics experts now had the suspect's DNA There was no evidence of a sexual assault at the crime scene in Radnage in Buckinghamshire, picturedMembers of Mrs Brown's family, pictured, made a similar appeal 20 years ago following her brutal murderDetectives said that whomever the attacker was had brought the hand-cuffs and tape used to restrain Mrs Brown along with them.Despite what police called a 'thorough and professional investigation' at the time the killer has eluded capture, leaving her broken-hearted family without justice.In a bid to finally find the culprit, detectives turned to modern scientific techniques to analyse clues found at the time.Peter Beirne, the head of Thames Valley Police's major crime investigation review team, revealed a DNA sample belonging to an unknown person had now been successfully extracted.'These new tests have produced a DNA sample,' he said.'It does not belong to the family and we believe it could be a vital piece of evidence linking the killer to the scene.'He would not reveal what item the DNA sample was taken from.Police say there are plans to swab a number of people who featured in the original investigation, but stress there were 'no suspects, as such' - there have never been any arrests over the case.Instead, Mr Beirne said he was first appealing to the public to put forward names of anyone they believe may have been involved, who would then be tested.It would then be 'a simple task to either eliminate or implicate people as the source of the DNA', he added.Mr Beirne, a retired veteran police officer with more than 30 years experience as a detective, said if nothing useful comes to light then investigators may then look at 'a potential mass screening' in the area.He said: 'Janet's death left three children without a mother.'We want to bring justice to Janet's family.'If people have suspicions, I would urge them to contact police.'Mr Beirne added: 'Somebody out there knows who killed Janet - we're asking them to make contact.'Also appealing to the public, Roxanne Brown said: 'We need your help to find them.'It was revealed had she survived, Mrs Brown would now be a grandmother with detectives saying the youngsters had been robbed of the chance to know her.A \u00a320,000 reward is being offered for information leading to a successful conviction of the killer.Anyone who believes they may have any information about the crime is urged to call the police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Cold case detectives have relaunched a murder inquiry 25 years after a man was reported missing by his girlfriend.Andrew Bedford was 27-years-old when he disappeared in 1990. He was last seen eating a takeaway, possibly fish and chips, in a car in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire.The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit has today issued a fresh appeal for information on what would have been his 52nd birthday.Andrew Bedford was 27 when he went missing from a takeaway in Ramsay, Cambridgeshire in 1990Officers say that given the circumstances surrounding his disappearance and the amount of time that has passed, they are now confident he was murdered.They believe he was killed on September 28 with a shotgun at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists, in the market town.Detective Inspector Ian Simmons said: 'A team of detectives from the three force Major Investigations Unit is devoted to the cold case and we want to speak to anyone who has any information about Mr Bedford's disappearance and death.'We would particularly like to speak to people who came forward before but maybe did not tell us everything they knew.'No unsolved crime is ever closed. Where there is an opportunity to bring those who have escaped justice to account we will.'We are in contact with Mr Bedford's family and keeping them fully informed of developments.'Mr Bedford, then of Tweet Street, Huntingdon, was last seen in a light blue Ford Cortina at 6.20pm on September 28 1990 in Factory Bank, Ramsey. He was reported missing the next day.He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers and was described as 5ft 8ins, of medium build, with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and various tattoos.Despite a huge police inquiry, which included extensive searches by helicopter and specialist divers, a nationwide poster campaign and a reconstruction on Crimestoppers, no trace of Mr Bedford was found.Three people were arrested but released without charge.The prime suspect for the shooting is now dead but others who were involved have never been brought to justice, the force said.Anyone with information should contact the Major Crime Unit on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.", "ref": "Janet Brown was killed at her Buckinghamshire home in April 1995..

The three leaders' wives were on parade yesterday, marching across the country in support of their men, in support of the political party into which they married, in support of desperately important employment issues \u2013 keeping their idiot husbands in a job.In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband and Miriam Clegg proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than one.Indeed, Samantha and Justine marched out in almost identical uniforms; dark slacks and blazers, paired with crisp shirts and sensible shoes. They looked like a pair of lady pilots from the budget Deficit airline, ready for their long haul flight to or from the land of Austerity, depending on whose husband wins. The only accessory missing were their welfare caps, which they must have left at home.Scroll down for video In the corridors of power, Samantha Cameron, Justine Miliband  (left) and Miriam Clegg (right) proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers, in more ways than oneSam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wife. That was until she visited a Sikh family for a cup of tea. Mrs Cameron respectfully took her shoes off before entering the home of local businessman Baljinder Hansraas and before anyone could scream: 'Holy footcream!' she unleashed them.Out popped a pair of startling tootsies, displaying what might just have been a hint of a bunion. All across the Home Counties, fragrant Tory women fell into a dead faint. For Sam Cam's seldom seen feet seemed ever so slightly unkempt, unusual from a woman noted for her effortless elegance. They didn't even seem very Tory toenails. Shriek \u2013 not even a drop of nail polish! I don't know what the grooming squad will have to say about that, but I doubt it will be very flattering.Sam Cam put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west London. Well, almost. Badge on lapel, leaflets in hand, smart white loafers tripping lightly over the Hounslow flagstones, she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal Conservative wifePerhaps we should not be too harsh. Not many women would come out smelling of roses and peppermint foot lotion if they unexpectedly had to reveal their workaday feet, still slightly steaming from punishing the pavements, to the nation.Yesterday's shock unveiling of Crinkletoes Cameron was reminiscent of a moment during the last election, when Sarah Brown's mangled trotters were revealed on a visit to a Hindu temple. The same furore greeted Brown's podiatric horror story. And the message was the same. Woman goes out in public without painted toenails? The end of civilisation is nigh.Poor Sam Cam. If she had unveiled the perfect trimmed pedicure and three glistening coats of Rouge Noir, she would be accused of being self-indulgent. Wasting money on luxuries or wandering around with battered trotters. She can't win. But in this election, who can?Justine resolutely wore the exact same outfit she wore last week, sending out a Take Me Serious message that Clothes Don't Matter. Campaigning in Bradford, she looked like a grim pixie determined to prove to the Milifans that her man was the man. Or something like that.It was left to Miriam to show a bit of wackitude, pulling on a huge smile, a pair of Lib Dem yellow chinos and a nautical Breton top; she looked like Tweety Pie reporting for duty on the good ship Doomed. Miriam dragged her husband Nick along to a cookery lesson at a Wiltshire primary school. Aprons on, they exchanged loving looks as they and the pupils were shown how to make a variety of desserts using apples and blackberries. Soft fruit, fool, pudding and crumble? That is the history of the Lib Dems right there.Just a week to go and the wifely bandwagon rolls on. Their role is to be there, be visible, be bland and say nothing of import. In this carefully manicured \u2013 if not pedicured \u2013 election, the days of loudmouth Cherie wading in like a docker with gout have long gone. I almost miss them.Today's wives must smile nicely. Today's wives must not rock the boat. Today's wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret, massive wealth \u2013 although Samantha's two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under Tory central office radar. Above all, however, today's wives must remember that pulling your socks up is not as important as keeping them on.", "ref": "All the party leader's wives have been spotted looking stylish in trousers ..

Which is exactly what happened when Channel 4 news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy tried to ask the actor Robert Downey Jr about his drug-taking past. After questioning the 50-year-old actor as to whether he had managed to fight his demons the actor said: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy looks bemused as Robert Downey Junior walks out on an interview with him after the journalist asked him about his personal life In the footage of the short-lived chat Krishnan is then seen looking dumbfounded as Robert goes to head out of the room.The American star is in London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron but became aggravated when the chat took a turn for the personal. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy is then seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone.At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' The horror was clear to see on Robert's face as he questioned Krishnan about where he was trying to take their chat But Robert isn't the first celebrity to lose his cool in the face of an awkward line of questioning.  Naomi Campbell, Robert Pattinson and Peter Andre have all cut their chat time short - especially when, like with Mr Downey Jr, the conversation has turned to their private lives. Justin Bieber was once angered by a radio show host asked him about his friendship with One Direction and compared him to Justin Timberlake. And Rihanna became annoyed in Australia and cut off a chat about her film Battleship when questions began to focus on her love life. Here are the celebrities who couldn't stand the heat so they got out of the interview:  The model Naomi Campbell is known for her firey temper and stormed out of an interview - breaking a camera in her wake - after being asked about a blood diamond she had apparently been givenNAOMI CAMPBELL In April 2010 Naomi Campbell, who is known for her fiery temper, stormed out of an interview with ABC news kicking their camera over on the way. The reporter had asked the supermodel about whether she had received a blood diamond from the deposed Liberian despot Charles Taylor.Naomi said: 'I didn't receive a blood diamond and I'm not going to speak about that.' The interviewer continued to push the 44-year-old until she ended the chat curtly saying: 'Thank you very much,' and walking off.In court Naomi later admitted that she had been given, 'a few dirty rocks,' by Taylor when she testified against him.  Robert Pattinson became incredibly awkward whilst, when promoting Twilight: New Moon, he was asked about his relationship with Kristen Stewart ROBERT PATTINSON When Robert Pattinson was promoting the Twilight film New Moon in 2009 he had an awkward run-in with Ryan Seacrest. Ryan starts the interview by asking Rob about how he is finding fame but the conversation quickly turned to his then relationship with his co-star Kristen Stewart. Ryan quizzed the actor on what he tells fans when they ask about their relationship at which point his PR swiftly interjects and reprimands the Radio host.  Rob becomes visibly awkward and is ushered out of the interview as a stunned Seacrest reveals that it's the first time he's ever been cut off. As Rob leaves he jokes that he would tell his fans to watch this film but it doesn't do anything to ease the awkward tension. Justin Bieber might be close friends with One Direction but he didn't like it when a radio host asked about whether Harry Styles would flirt with his mum JUSTIN BIEBER In 2012 pop singer Justin Bieber did an incredibly awkward interview with the online American radio show, MOJO In The Morning. The host describes how the interview went 'horribly wrong,' saying that Justin initially got offended when he compared him to Justin Timberlake. Justin says: 'That's crazy 'cos our voices sound nothing alike... saying I sound like someone is not really a compliment.' He then got upset when the interviewer started asking him about One Direction, in particular Harry Styles.   The presenter questions him: 'Do you worry about Harry around your mum as he seems to like older women?' to which Justin retorts, 'I think you should worry about me round your mum, so...'The radio host then informs Justin that his mum is dead and the pop star hangs up on him. An awkward chat with Justin's 'people' ensued in which MOJO are told the singer won't be calling back. Peter Andre tried to keep his cool when he was interviewed by Kay Burley in 2010 but when the conversation turned to his children the TV presenter managed to reduce him to tears PETER ANDRE In 2010 Peter Andre joined Kay Burley on the coach for Sky News and she proceeded to prod him on his ex-wife Katie Price's recent marriage to Alex Reid. In particular the TV presenter was keen to know whether Peter and Katie's children were aware that their mother had re-married. Which lead them on to the subject of the model's first son Harvey. Harvey was the child of Price and footballer Dwight Yorke - although he was largely bought up by Andre, who still plays a role in his life to this day. During the segment Kay played Peter a clip of Dwight insinuating that the singer should never have said that he wanted to adopt the boy with whom the footballer has very little contact. An understandably defensive Peter went on to question whether Yorke had seen his son and to question why he Dwight would find Peter disrespectful when all he did was love his son. Kay then asked Peter how he would feel is Alex Reid wanted to adopt his two children Junior and Princess at which point the singer became upset asking for the interview to be terminated.  Rihanna cut an interview with Australian show Sunrise short when the interviewer asked her about her love lifeRIHANNA Rihanna was in Australia to promote her film Battleship in April 2012 when she became angry with a reporter from the show Sunrise. During an interview reporter Natalie Barr asked the star how frustrating it was to be linked to Hollywood names even if she wasn't dating them.To which Rihanna replied: 'Very frustrating. Almost as frustrating as being asked about it.' She went on to say: 'People are interested in a lot of things that don't matter or shouldn't.' Before ending the interview. It wasn't exactly S Club 7 themselves who decided to walk out on Claudia Winkleman who had an interview cut short with the band by their PR S CLUB 7In one of the most bizarre celebrity walk-outs of all time S Club 7 were forced to leave an interview with Claudia Winkleman by their screaming PR. It was 2003 and the band were discussing their imminent split with the TV presenter when she began to ask them about money. It had been rumoured at the time that, despite their manager Simon Fuller being worth around \u00a390million, the band hadn't been making enough money. Claudia asked them: 'There are rumours, I don't know how true they are, that you guys are grumpy that you haven't made a mint..'The bands PR then storms in saying: 'I'm not having this! I've had to come on here to get you to stop. Can you get up? We're going.'The Bee Gees had one of the most famous walk outs ever when they cut an interview with Clive Anderson short BEE GEES It's one of the most famous walk outs of all time when in 1997 Clive Anderson managed to annoy not one, not two but all three of the Bee Gees. Clive tries to joke with the band but after calling Barry Gibb a 't*****' he said: 'We're getting on like a storm, aren't we Clive? In fact I might just leave.'Robin and Maurice then followed at which point Clive revealed that he'd never had someone walk off before.", "ref": "Robert Downey Jr walked out of an interview with Channel 4..

He is pictured right in front of a target at a range wearing protective glassesAfter highlighting mass killings at schools across the US, he wrote that police were supportive of 'doing what is necessary to adequately protect our families and our homes.'His letter was called 'We're not in Mayberry Anymore, Toto' in a reference to the Andy Griffith Show set in a North Carolina town in the 1960s.According to the Detroit Free Press, he wrote: 'It is very common for Christians to simply assume that they live in Mayberry, trusting that because they know the Lord Jesus, everything will always be fine and nothing bad can happen to them and their families.'How to balance faith, reality, prudence, and trust is one of those critical questions that we struggle with all our lives. Pretending we are in Mayberry, while we are clearly not, can have very negative consequences for ourselves and those we love, especially those we have a responsibility to protect. If we are not in Mayberry, is there a real threat?'The newspaper reports that the priest informed parishioners about the CPL lessons during Palm Sunday mass and sent out the letter when some people questioned the idea.A bulletin on the church's website offers parishioners 'eight hour' CPL classes, which include instruction from law enforcement personnel, time on a range and use of guns and ammunition.It says that the cost is $125 per person and urges parishioners to register early as class sizes aer limited.Edward Fride, pictured next to a cut-out of the Pope, warned that crime had gone up in the area while budget cuts meant that there had been a 'reduction in the availability of an armed police response'Edward Fride posted this picture on his Facebook page along with the caption, 'Maybe I should get some of these - the way this day has been going, the zombies are bound to attack at sundown....'Edward Fride is the pastor at Christ the King Catholic Church (pictured) in Ann Arbor, MichiganRev Fride points out in his Mayberry letter that he was once a pacifist and had been a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. But after converting to Catholicism, he said he moved away from pacifism and questioned what his own response would be if he saw a woman being 'beaten or sexually assaulted, or somebody attacking kids.'He wrote: 'I eventually concluded that I was certainly no longer a pacifist absolutist; there were situations in which I would actively intervene, even to a lethal level if necessary.'The Free Press said it had been unable to reach Rev Fride for comment but that a spokesman for the Diocese of Lansing which oversees his parish had confirmed the letter had been sent out.Catholic Bishop Earl Boyea said that guns did not belong in a Catholic church while it was not appropriate to hold classes on church property, the paper reports.The statement added that Bishop Boyea 'has never given permission for anyone to carry a concealed weapon in a church or school in the Diocese of Lansing' and that churches in the diocese were 'gun-free zones'.", "ref": "The reverend edward Fride invited parishioners to take part in gun classes..

Charlie said he didn't find it embarrassing but said: 'I think it's a bit odd that loads of people have watched it.Their father Howard, had only ever uploaded the video because it was too big to send over email.Harry (left) and Charlie (right) starred in the Youtube clip which has amassed millions and millions of views The show also reveals that the boys' video has had more views than Taylor Swift, One Direction and even Adele.Their parents have since made thousands of pounds from advertising and sponsorship deals off the back of the clip. Howard said at the time: 'The clip only went up as I wanted to share it with the boys' godfather. I was naive about the whole YouTube thing. 'It became viral and once that happened there was nothing I could do. People have sent lovely comments and messages and I now upload a new video of the boys every six weeks.'", "ref": "Harry and Charlie davies-carr starred in the clip some eight years ago..

Little did she know she would never get the chance to wear it, despite already paying for half. The 31-year-old said when she slipped into the white lacy gown, she instantly saw herself standing in front of her friends and family and exchanging marriage vows with the love of her life.'I had dreamt about this princess dress since I was a little girl,' she told Daily Mail Australia.Adele McKenzie was set to marry the love of her life, David Elliot, when she was devastated to learn the bridal company she had paid around $1,000 to for her dress had closed downMs McKenzie said she wasn't able to buy the $2,000 dress outright so she organised a payment plan with 'The Bridal Centre'.She started paying in February and planned to pay off her dress by July - around three months before her wedding - giving her time to make alterations. In early April, Ms McKenzie's dress dream was shattered when she opened an email from the bridal company that said they were going bankrupt.Ms McKenzie told Daily Mail Australia she was left feeling 'panicked' and 'anxious' when she was faced with the news that she would need to find a new wedding dress for her big day.'My first reaction was to call The Bridal Centre and it was consistently busy across the long weekend. Their Facebook was active and we were putting up posts without a response.'The Bridal Centre's Facebook page was inundated with messages from disappointed brides who already had their hearts set on a wedding dressMs McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same 'generic' email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with their weddings only weeks away.She tried to go onto the Bridal Centre's website but it was deactivated and that's when she realised she had no way of getting in contact with the company she already paid $1,000, which was meant to go towards paying off her dress.The happy couple have been together for nine years and plan to wed in November 2015'It was stressful and pretty upsetting,' she said.Ms McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same 'generic' email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with weddings only weeks away.Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time.Ms McKenzie said the group called 'Where's My Dress?' became inundated with 'generous offers' from 'lovely ladies' and 'amazing bridal companies' who offered them free 'pre-loved', and even brand new, wedding gowns.While some women have received their money back, unfortunately Ms McKenzie said she is still waiting to hear from the Bridal Centre about whether she will be one of the lucky ones who can use that money to buy another dress.Ms McKenzie revealed she would need another $1,000 deposit to move forward with a different dress, however at this stage, with all the financial pressure that comes with planning a wedding, she isn't sure she can afford it.'It's very difficult financially, I can't take the next step to get another dress. I don't know if I'm going to get it back.''I am six months out of my wedding and I'm anxious and stressed out,' she said. Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time.Ms McKenzie is expecting around 70 guests at her wedding that will be held in Sydney's Terrey Hills, with some travelling from interstate and overseas.   'There's a lot of planning and  it's added pressure on top.''It's getting more difficult as the weeks draw closer,' she added.Ms McKenzie said the trusting brides had no idea the company was facing financial difficulties as they continued to take payments from their clients right up until the day before they sent the email that notified them of their money woes.'[It] is just disgraceful. They knew what was happening. If they didn't want to tell us the truth, that's fine, but don't take our money,' she said.'At the end of the day, I'm marrying the man of my dreams so I'm trying to not let it affect it too much.'After thinking she had secured the dress she had dreamed of since she was a little girl, Ms McKenzie said she was devastated she was going to have to fight to get it back.'You find this dress and you fall in love with it. Now I have to go through this process, it's so upsetting.'I don't want this,' she added.Ms McKenzie said despite her awful experience she is trying to move forward and instead focus on  on the man who will be standing at the end of the aisle, regardless of what she is wearing.'At the end of the day, I'm marrying the man of my dreams so I'm trying to not let it affect it too much.'", "ref": "The Bridal Centre, in brisbane, shut down unexpectedly earlier this month..

According to a Wall Street Journal report Thursday, Chinese nuclear experts have told the United States that Pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. And while that number may seem stunning, it is actually only part of a troubling story.The key takeaway from the latest assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads, but the type of warhead, as this gives a better clue to the future of the country's weapons capabilities.True, the reported Chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear \"arsenal.\" However, this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by U.S. and other experts.The big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that North Korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons-grade uranium. If that assessment is correct, and Pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly-enriched weapons-grade uranium, then the plutonium program that the U.S. and members of the Six-Party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial. After all, the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually. This news could be much more serious.Why? For a start, it would mean that North Korea's activities would undoubtedly meet the definition, if it had not already, of a runaway nuclear weapons program, with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in North Korea's mines. In addition, while the plutonium program at Yongbyon has a clear and detectable profile, the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium-based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile, meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in North Korea, undetectable from the sky, but in any large warehouse.Washington and Seoul have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying North Korean threats, at least when there isn't a full-fledged crisis going on. For example, the United States downplayed North Korea's missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in December 2012. And up until 2006, no one thought the Kim regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test. These new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat North Korea poses once again.But Thursday's report isn't the only troubling information we have had recently. Just as concerning is the NORAD commander's assessment on North Korea's missile capabilities. On April 7, Adm. Bill Gortney said during a press briefing that the Defense Department believed Pyongyang's KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is operational, with a warhead capacity.This statement is troubling for two reasons. First, Gortney's statement, when combined with the latest Chinese assessment, implies that North Korea now not only has nuclear weapons, but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the U.S. mainland.Second, and just as importantly, Pyongyang's advances in mobile ICBM capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the Korean Peninsula. Put simply, these capabilities could give North Korea confidence that it is immune from any U.S. counterstrikes.And if that ends up being the case, the United States could find itself with a renewed headache in Asia -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling.", "ref": "Report says North Korea may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads..

Ginneti's jail terms begins April 10.In court Friday, Mrs Ginneti wept as she read a letter of apology in hopes of offering the victim 'closure for this nightmare.'Prosecutors said the boy had seen his grades drop in his senior year and has been struggling with social interactions.The former educator described for the court how she has reconciled with her family and embarked on a new career as a fitness instructor. In her time off, she volunteers at a church, reported Philadelphia Inquirer.Judge Garrett Page told Ginneti he was certain she would continue to turn her life around, but he reminded her that her ill-thought actions had had devastating consequences.'One bad day because of sexual hunger has resulted in all this avalanche of harm,' Page stated.He also chastised her for sending her male student explicit photos and videos of herself, which he likened to 'dangling candy' in front of the boy.The judge later clarified that he does not think the defendant is a 'bad human being,' but stated she must be punished for her 'bad act.'Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gymGinneti's attorney asked the judge to spare her jail time so she could care for her small children.She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January.According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym.A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis.The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times.According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the student met for coffee in Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in her car.She then allegedly dropped her paramour back at the coffee shop and told him not to tell anyone about the encounter.Authorities say the investigation began after they received a tip-off that students had been overheard discussing X-rated pictures showing a minor and Ginnetti doing 'sexual things.'When police questioned the 17-year-old boy, he came clean about the affair and Ginnetti then also confessed to having a relationship with the student, police said.Watch the full report on CBS Philly here. Two months after Ginnetti first met her 17-year-old victim at his prom in May 2013 they drove to an industrial park and had sex in her carThe 35-year-old, pictured above after her arrest in January 2014, will have to perform community service and register as a sex offender 'I would say that she treated her relationship with this student as she would have treated a relationship with an adult with whom she was involved,' Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told The Mercury News in January.Police said they found several texts the lovers had exchanged discussing their July outing and one mentioning 'a used condom that had been left in Ginnetti's vehicle,' according to the criminal complaint.On the night of the alleged tryst, after he returned home, the student told police he got a text from Ginnetti asking him to 'do it again.'As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children, ages 8, 11 and 14. She also had to surrender her passport, and the authorities have been keeping track of her using a GPS device.

Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'.  He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today.Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova ScotiaTitanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14'You would not use it for practical purposes but have it on display. It would make a great conversation piece.'There were a couple of thousand deckchairs on board Titanic and many of them were found floating on the wreck site. 'We have been able to access the Mackay-Bennett's log book, which confirmed the crew not only picked up deckchairs but that the ship's carpenter spent time repairing some of them on the way back to Halifax.' The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall.It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the TitanicIt has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic. Upon his death in 1973, Capt Lemarteleur gave the chair to colleague Captain Robin Lee. The current owner acquired it in 2001.Being sold with the chair is an in depth 'provenance package' that authenticates history and association with Titanic.Captain Julien Lemarteleur (above), who collected the chair from the Mackay-Bennett more than 100 years agoIt includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s.In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired.'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.'Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia.He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story.'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.'Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14.A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York.White Star Line chartered four ships, including the Halifax-based cable-laying vessel the Mackay-Bennett, to recover the bodies.The deckchair is being sold in Devizes, Wiltshire on April 18.March 31, 1909: Construction work on Titanic begins in Belfast Harbour.May 31, 1911: Titanic is first launched in front of an audience of 100,000 people.April 10, 1912: Titanic departs Southampton around noon with 922 passengers on board. Minutes later, it narrowly avoids colliding with two ships, New York and Oceanic.4pm: 274 passengers embark at Cherbourg, France.8pm: Titanic leaves Cherbourg, bound for Queenstown, Ireland.April 11: The ship arrives at Cork, Ireland, around 11.30am.1:30pm: Titanic departs from Ireland after picking up 113 more passengers and sets off for America.April 14: Titanic's crew are warned by other ships of drifting icebergs.11:40pm: The ship's lookout spots an iceberg immediately ahead and warns the captain, but it is too late. Titanic collides with it and begins taking on water.April 15: Titanic suddenly starts sinking faster around 2.20am, plunging more than a thousand people into the freezing cold water.4am: First ship arrives after an earlier SOS call from Titanic, saving 710 people.September 1985: The wreck of Titanic is found.", "ref": "Chair was on first class deck when ship hit an iceberg in April 1912..

'Gross household debt in Portugal and the United Kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other advanced economies.' Soaring house prices have pushed up household debt in Britain in recent years \u2013 raising fears that families are over-stretching themselves to get on the property ladder or buy a bigger home.The Bank of England has clamped down on the sort of risky mortgage lending that was rife in the build-up to the financial crisis, in an effort to prevent another housing boom and bust. But the IMF said: 'Containing financial stability risks from housing and mortgage markets remains important.'It also said 'measures to increase housing supply are a priority' for the UK given the shortage of homes and swelling population. Both the Tories and Labour have promised to step-up house building after the General Election.IMF figures showed household debt in the UK was worth 87.1 per cent of gross domestic product, or total economic output, last year.That compares with 82.6 per cent in Portugal and 76.9 per cent in the United States. Debt levels are far lower in much of Europe, at 72 per cent in Spain, around 55 per cent in Germany and France, and just over 40 per cent in Italy.Douro River, Porto, Portugal: The IMF report lumped Britain together with a country that was forced to seek emergency funding during the eurozone crisisA separate report will today claim 13million Britons will dive further into debt this year \u2013 a 40 per cent rise on 2014. The survey of 2,000 people found that, of the two-thirds of British adults already in debt from credit cards, overdrafts and loans, a quarter will have to borrow even more to cope.Kevin Mountford of MoneySuperMarket.com, which was behind the research, said: 'It's important that those relying on credit keep in control of the situation, so their debt doesn't spiral out of control.'Simply working out a realistic monthly budget and cutting out unnecessary expenditure should be the first step.' THE cost of moving house has soared to \u00a312,000, figures show.Rising estate agents' fees, removal costs and stamp duty helped push the total bill up 60 per cent between 2004 and last year \u2013 double the inflation rate.And it is forecast to hit \u00a315,000 in five years despite recent reforms to curb stamp duty costs.The sky-high price of moving does not include the deposit \u2013 \u00a390,000 for the average buyer.Experts said it could be putting families off moving house at a time when demand for properties has already fallen away.A study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found the bill for moving typically includes more than \u00a35,000 in estate agents' fees, \u00a33,600 in stamp duty and \u00a31,400 in solicitors' conveyancing bills.Paula Higgins, of consumer group the HomeOwners' Alliance, said: 'This is more bad news for struggling families.'", "ref": "Borrowing to buy has left UK more indebted than other developed nations..

Either prices are inflated or you're picking up problem players other clubs don't want.This year, it seems, has proved no different. Big-money buys have struggled to impact, while loan signings, too, have not had the desired effect.Here, Sportsmail looks at five winter-window arrivals who have disappointed for their new employers\u2026Juan Cuardrado arrived at Chelsea for \u00a323m from Fiorentina but has failed to impress at Stamford BridgeJuan Cuadrado (Chelsea)For a fee in the region of \u00a323m and arriving from Fiorentina with a reputation bloated by his impressive performance for Colombia at last summer's World Cup, Cuadrado was expected to help fire Chelsea towards the Premier League and Champions League crowns.In nearly three months, however, he has played just over three hours of top-flight football, failing to score or create a goal in that period.The Colombian winger arrived with a big reputation after starring at the 2014 World CupMeanwhile, during the Champions League exit to PSG, Cuadrado appeared for just 11 minutes and remained a spectator as they were eliminated following the second leg at Stamford Bridge.Perhaps next season was always pencilled in for the explosive winger to make his impact, but the jury remains very much out based on his early efforts.Wilfried Bony (Man City)With Sergio Aguero perennially troubled by injury problems and Edin Dzeko about as reliable as his team-mate's hamstrings, \u00a328m Swansea striker Bony was supposed to be the man to take on the scoring mantle and see home City's defence of their title.Wilfried Bony has netted only one goal as Manchester City have slipped out of the title raceHis arrival, of course, was delayed by participation at the Africa Cup of Nations, but Bony has done little to breathe new life into City's stuttering season.There has been just one goal \u2013 the opener in a routine 3-0 home win over West Brom \u2013 and he has missed the last two matches \u2013 including the derby defeat at Manchester United \u2013 after turning an ankle in training.The former Swansea striker scored more Premier League goals than any other player in 2014He has started just two games and his involvement during the Champions League defeat to Barcelona was restricted to 18 minutes at the Nou Camp.Bony will have to hit the ground running next season or his days at City could soon be numbered.Mauro Zarate (QPR)Perhaps the Argentinian should have taken the hint when Harry Redknapp tried to send him back to West Ham before he had even kicked a ball for the R's.Mauro Zarate has failed to make an impression at Loftus Road during his loanPremier League rules meant he had to stay and, four substitute appearances later, Zarate is yet to score or lay on a goal for his latest employers.Zarate fared slightly better at Birmingham City in 2008 when, during another loan stay, he netted four times.Zarate scored two goals in seven appearances for West Ham before being farmed out on loanThat, though, was not enough to keep the Blues in the Premier League and it looks as if he'll have a second relegation on his C.V. come May.Callum McManaman (West Brom)The \u00a34.75m capture of McManaman from Wigan was hailed as something of a coup given how he had impressed for the Latics on occasion.Callum McManaman's move to the Hawthorns has coincided with West Brom's slip into relegation battleBut therein lies the problem with the combative forward \u2013 getting him on the pitch and keeping him there.Talented, no doubt, but McManaman's progress at The Hawthorns has been curtailed by an ankle problem and six appearances later he is yet to trouble the scorers.The Scotland international was one of the stars of Wigan's unlikely FA Cup victory in 2013He hasn't featured for over a month and, in that time, West Brom have slid back towards the relegation mire.McManaman's arrival was intended to help safeguard against such a scenario, so in that respect the signing has disappointed.Filip Djuricic (Southampton)Big things were expected of the Serbia international given Ronald Koeman's prior knowledge of the skilful winger \u2013 who played for Heerenveen in Holland - and Southampton's recent record in the transfer market.Ronald Koeman brought in the talented forward, but Filip Djuricic is yet to complete 90mins for the SaintsThere have been flashes of promise but the 23-year-old is yet to play a full 90 minutes for the Saints and now finds himself sidelined with an ankle problem.Djuricic \u2013 on loan from Benfica \u2013 wants to make permanent his stay on the south coast, but injury could rob him of the chance to impress.The on-loan Benfica winger (left) will have to do more to make his move to St Mary's permanent", "ref": "Several january signings have failed to impress in the Premier League..

Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissedMeekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time The SFA published the reasons given by the chair of the three-man panel.They read: 'Further to the judicial panel hearing yesterday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings' solicitor.'In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter.'The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory'It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.'The decision could effectively blunt the SFA's powers to bring retrospective cases against players, unless an incident has been completely missed by all match officials.Players have previously been cited for diving to win penalties.The rule states that the compliance officer can bring cases for alleged sending-off offences 'not seen by match officials'.The Meekings case was brought because referee Steven McLean and his team had not seen the ball hit the defender's hand.  PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart had warned before the verdict that the SFA was veering into dangerous territory.He said: 'I think you have seen this week from the reaction of players across the country, players have no problem with video evidence being used for incidents that genuinely haven't been seen by the referee.'Maybe a punch behind the referee's back and fly kick when the ball is away.'But we think, if the rule has been extended, then it is now erring into re-refereeing a game on a Monday.'That's not the purpose of video evidence. That's why the English FA and FIFA and UEFA steer away from that. The referee could see the incident on Sunday, he just didn't see the handball.'", "ref": "Inverness defender Josh Meekings won appeal against one-match ban..

The city lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress (pictured). Three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen, leading to vast, winding tunnelsThe subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of Earth.It lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress and the surrounding area, which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (TOK\u0130).The multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, according to a report in National Geographic.The find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement.A view of the underground city newly discovered in Turkey's Central Anatolian province of Nevsehir, which is famous for fairy chimney rock formations. The city was built from volcanic ash rockThe latest find is thought to be the biggest underground city in Cappadocia, consisting of 3.5 miles (7km) of tunnels, secret churches, tombs and safe havens. Scientists have yet to discover all its secret passagesCappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations.Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.'The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material.The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks.The latest find is similar to the discovery of another underground city, Derinkuyu, which was made in 1963 when a man took down the wall in his basement.Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances.Derinkuyu was once home to 20,000 residents living together underground, in a city eleven levels deep with 600 entrances.It had areas for sleeping, stables, wells, kitchens, ventilation shafts, tombs, communal rooms, bathrooms.Like Derinkuyu, the latest underground city was built to protect residents from invaders, but remains largely unexplored.But this city is far larger, with early estimates suggesting it could be around a third bigger than Derinkuyu.Geophysicists from Nev\u015fehir University recently conducted a systematic study of a 1.5 mile (4 km) area using geophysical resistivity and seismic tomography.The studies suggest the underground corridors may go as deep as 371ft (113 metres), but the exact size remains unknown.Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations.Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash.

I played 72, 73 minutes and hopefully I can be part of the team next week.'We will see what happens. I don't think I could play 90 minutes yet, especially not on a level higher, so we will have to build it up and see how it goes.'De Jong, a \u00a36million summer signing from Ajax, has made only three senior appearances and just a single league start for the club after first suffering a serious thigh injury and then being laid low by a recurrence of a lung problem.His battle for fitness has proved both gruelling and frustrating, and he is already looking forward to the start of the new campaign and launching his Magpies career in earnest.He said: 'It's getting a little bit better. I still feel that it just improves every day, but I still need to keep on improving. I feel it in the power training, but also on the field and in the game.'I just need to get a few more games in, and I think that will hopefully be a couple of games his season, otherwise start again good next season from pre-season on.'The Dutchman was a \u00a36m summer signing from Ajax but has struggled with injuriesDe Jong was signed to help provide a link between midfield and attack and the kind of invention he provides has been sadly lacking for much of the campaign, particularly in recent weeks as a run of six successive league defeats has left Newcastle too close for comfort to the relegation zone.Victory - something they have not tasted since February 28 - over the Swans on Saturday would go a long way towards erasing any fears of being sucked into trouble, although with many fans in open rebellion over owner Mike Ashley's stewardship, it may do little to ease the tension on Tyneside.", "ref": "Siem de Jong set up Adam Armstrong for winner in 2-1 Aston Villa win..

He was deported by the Turkish authorities and flown back to Britain on a plane packed with holidaymakers last night.Ahmed and eight of his relatives - including four children ranging from a one-year-old baby to an 11-year-old - were stopped on the Turkish border with Syria on April 1.Scroll down for video Arrested: Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor, has been held at Birmingham Airport after returning for allegedly trying to sneak into Syria with eight members of his family (pictured in Turkey)Convoy: Ahmed was seen being moved by Turkish police on Sunday and then put on a Monarch-operated Flight from Dalaman which landed at Birmingham Airport at 12.14am todayThey were arrested by Turkish police within walking distance of the border with Syria in the town of Reyhanli earlier this month. Ahmed was filmed leaving Antakya police station in the Hatay Province in southern Turkey and getting on a coach to Antalya, which is 500 miles to the west, on Sunday.And he is believed to have arrived back in the UK on Monarch-operated Flight ZB 909 from Dalaman which landed at Birmingham Airport at 12.14am today.Greater Manchester Police said they are working to ensure the safe return of the rest of the group, which included four children aged one, three, eight and 11.In a statement, the force said: 'In the early hours of Tuesday 14 April 2015, a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of Commission, Preparation or Instigation of acts of Terrorism at Birmingham Airport'.All smiles: Waheed Ahmed  looks relaxed as he begins his journey back to the UK after being caught trying to sneak into Syria with eight family membersOn the way home: The 21-year-old, sporting a shaved head, was filmed being escorted from a vehicleLate yesterday a 31-year-old man was arrested in Rochdale for the same offence.Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed arriving back at his home today bur he refused to comment on his son's arrestFellow passengers said they were held in their seats before a man thought to be Ahmed, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was whisked off the plane.One man who was on the flight said: 'We landed and taxied to the terminal and then there was an announcement over the tannoy.'It said someone needed special assistance and we had to remain in our seats.'Then a plain-clothed policeman got on the plane and escorted someone off. It was quite far away from me so I couldn't make out what they looked like.'There were other police officers on the tarmac too and they got into a car and drove off. It all happened very quickly.'Other travellers said they saw a police van and car driving away from a side exit at the airport shortly after the plane landed.The student's father, Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - who has been pictured with party leader Ed Miliband - previously said he wanted his son 'to come home as soon as possible'.Mr Ahmed, who sits on Rochdale Borough Council, thought his son had been in Birmingham on a work placement when he discovered that he had been detained in Turkey.Police searched the councillor's home earlier this month for clues about why Ahmed had travelled to the country.In a statement Councillor Shakil Ahmed said: 'My son is a good Muslim and his loyalties belong to Britain, so I don't understand what he's doing there.'If I thought for a second that he was in danger of being radicalised, I would have reported him to the authorities.'He's studying a degree in politics and sociology at Manchester University and has a good future ahead of him.'Waheed Ahmed, 21,  is the son of Rochdale Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed (pictured above with Ed Miliband)Greater Manchester Police and the North West Counter Terrorism Unit have launched an investigation to establish why the group apparently tried to enter Syria.Assistant Chief Constable Ian Wiggett said the primary concern was the 'safety and welfare' of the children, and efforts were being made to ensure a 'full safeguarding strategy' was in place upon their return.

The inhabitants of the Scottish cathedral town have gone into overdrive for wedding of their most famous resident, lining the streets with bunting and creating special-themed produce in many of the stories. Since the Wimbledon champion announced his plans to say 'I do' at the cathedral, there have also been plans to line the streets with well-wishers as the couple make their way to the venue. Andy Murray and Kim Sears are preparing to marry in his home town of Dunblane this weekend Messages to the happy couple are in many of the shop windows and several business owners have already sent gifts to either Andy, 27, or his bride-to-be ahead of the big day.Lesley Anderson, 52, who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears six weeks ago and received kind a thank you note which said it was 'gorgeous'.The ivory-coloured piece is hand-embroidered on the inside with the couple's initials and wedding date and was designed by Nicola Ure from K C Bridal specialists in Falkirk. A handmade card featuring Andy and Kim, 27, on the front drawn by local artist Lorna Brown accompanied the garter. Local shops and shop owners are preparing their shop fronts to reflect the great dayMany of the local businesses have decorated their shop fronts with colourful buntingThe card shows Andy in his kilt holding a tennis racket and Kim in her dress along with their Border Terriers.Kim's reply to the gifts read: 'Dear Lesley and all at Point Nouveau Bridal.'Just a little note to say a huge thank you for the gorgeous gift Nicola made for me.'It was very kind of you and I hadn't found a garter yet so thanks ever so much.'Also, that card of Lorna Brown's is absolutely fabulous! It really made us giggle, especially our two little dogs in the background!'We are really excited for our big day in a month's time and are happy to be celebrating our wedding in Dunblane.'Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and generosity. Best wishes, Kim Sears X.'Lesley Anderson, 52, (left) who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears with a hand-drawn picture of the couple (left). Kim replied with a handwritten note (rightLesley is close friends with Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, 83 and gave the garter and card to her to take to Kim.She said: 'Out of the blue we got this beautiful card. To be honest we never ever thought we would hear very much at all so when we got this beautiful card we were chuffed to bits.'I was absolutely delighted. This was such a personal thing. We were really, really chuffed. Andy continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning Wimbledon,  he shook hands with all the shop owners on the Dunblane High street.  When Murray, 27, says 'I do' on April 11, the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends.A local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window Murray's status as one of the world's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from A-list celebrities such as James Corden to the Prime Minister and even the Queen. But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman.Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.'A sign telling people about parking restrictions around Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Andy's wedding to KimMurray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such.'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.'There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple will hold their nuptials Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. For the 27-year-old's many fans and friends in the town,  at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community.It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck \u2013 so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. Kim shows off her engagement ring at the Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, last January The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day.Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past.Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim's been pretty much doing it''I've tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven't been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn't think I was going to.He added: 'It's a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'", "ref": "Andy Murray and Kim Sears are getting married in Dunblane this weekend..

Mr Javid said: 'Well, first of all the perpetrators were disproportionately Asian Muslim men, and I absolutely think there has been a misplaced sense of political correctness that prevented authorities, whether social workers or police, from properly investigating what was going on.'If we are to learn proper lessons from this, we have to look at the cultural side of some communities in Britain and see why it is that in some communities there are men that have a view of women that is completely unacceptable in modern British society. Why do they have such a low value of women that they see them as commodities to be abused?'The Tory minister said the authorities had to 'get to the bottom of this' and emphasised that 'we have to look at the cultural aspects of it'.The Tory minister's comments come after inquiries into the sexual abuse of vulnerable girls targeted by Asian men in Rochdale, Rotherham and Oxford found that the authorities had failed to protect themHe urged Asian communities to look into 'what might be going on that we don't know about'. Mr Javid said: 'We can no longer be held back in any sense by political correctness.'I know plenty of people, British Muslims, men and women, who would 100 per cent agree with that, not only out of a sense of shame but also because of the fear of what else might be going on. Some of the values that certain people in some communities have, in their attitudes to women or on the question of freedom of expression, are just totally unacceptable in British society.'We do no one any favours when we don't investigate or talk about them.'Mr Javid revealed in a speech to the Union of Jewish Students in 2014 that he had experienced racism at school. He said he was called a 'Paki' by a classmate. He said: 'I did what any cool, calm future Cabinet minister would do. I hit him. And then he hit me, and I hit him back and things sort of went downhill from there.'Mr Javid, whose background is remarkably different to many of his colleagues, has been tipped as a future Tory leader.His parents came to Britain from Pakistan in 1961. His father, Abdul-Ghani, worked in a cotton mill before getting a job as a bus conductor.", "ref": "He said some values in certain communities were 'totally unacceptable' comments come after sexual abuse by Asian men revealed in parts of uk..

Identical twins Marcus and Markieff Morris, who both play forward for the Phoenix Suns, are now the focus of an investigation into a felony aggravated assault which allegedly occurred in January. Phoenix police say the 25-year-old twins and three others assaulted Erik Hood at the Nina Mason Pulliam Recreation & Sports Complex where the alleged victim and a woman were watching a basketball game. Scroll down for video Markieff Morris (No. 11, left) and Marcus Morris (No 15, right) are forwards for the Phoenix Suns in the NBAMarcus (left) and Markieff (right) with mother Thomasine Morris while they were attending Kansas UniversityThe Morris twins are being investigated for allegedly assaulting Erik Hood at 7:30pm on Saturday, January 24No charges have been filed and no arrests have been made, but a Maricopa County Attorney's Office spokesman confirmed prosecutors are continuing to review the case submitted by police, the Arizona Republic reported. The alleged assault happened around 7:30pm on Saturday, January 24, outside the central Phoenix gym, according to CBS5-TV. Hood, 36, told police he knows the twins from when he mentored them while they were growing up in Philadelphia and that he used to support them financially until they had a 'falling out'. He told police he sent a text telling the twins' mother, Thomasine Morris, he'd 'always be there for her' and that another friend, Julius Kane, 25, saw the message and concluded their relationship was sexual in nature. The twins, 25, who are basically inseparable at all times, prefer to be called Team FOE (Family Over Everything)Hood told police he sent a text telling the twins' mother, Thomasine (pictured) he would 'always be there for her'The former basketball player showed police photographs of himself with the twins. In addition to the twins, who like to be called Team FOE (Family Over Everything), Hood also said Kane helped carry out the assault against him. During the reported confrontation, Hood told police he was held down, punched in the head, kicked and then beaten to the point of unconsciousness after he was able to briefly escape. Following the assault, witnesses told police they saw five subjects flee in a Rolls-Royce Phantom.The twin brothers both declined to comment after Phoenix lost to the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday nightAfter the assault, witnesses told police they saw five subjects flee in a Rolls-Royce Phantom (example pictured)Police say five suspects assaulted Hood at the Nina Mason Pulliam Recreation & Sports Complex (pictured)The Morris twins previously denied assaulting HoodHood ended up with abrasions, a large knot on his head and a broken nose. The woman he was with corroborated his story and also identified the twins and Kane. The Morris twins have denied assaulting Hood, but Markieff did admit being at the game because he sponsors one of the teams with Marcus.They both declined to comment after their loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night.Markieff and Marcus live together, have the same tattoos, the same agent and recently signed a four-year extension worth $52million which they were allowed to divvy up however they wanted, Rolling Stone reported. (Markieff is now getting $8million a year and Marcus is getting $5million.)Marcus, who is younger by seven minutes, said: 'We've been like this since we were young.'We've always been doing everything together.'Whether it's kickball, baseball, whatever \u2013 we've always been together.'Before the NBA, the twins attended Kansas University where they both majored in American Studies and took every single class together.", "ref": "Identical twins Marcus and Markieff Morris, 25, play for the Phoenix Suns..

Doctors say he may not be able to walkAbout 15 to 20 cases of PKS are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of AustraliaPKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia.It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects.Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition.'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia.'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way.'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.'The condition is often undiagnosed during pregnancy and is identified at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complicationMs Maitai said she was heartbroken when she learnt about her son's conditionA fundraising page was set up to help the struggling family on mycause , so far raising more than $18,000While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai (left) and at home her seven-year-old daughter Serenity (right)The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai and at home with her seven-year-old daughter Serenity, the financial strain of being without a job and dependent on $90 from welfare is taking its toll.The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 each week.A fundraising page on mycause was set up to help the struggling family, which at the time of publication raised more than $18,000.'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said.'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent.'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes.'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi.'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.'  Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard.'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said.'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder.According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide.About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia.'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states.The condition is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is more commonly discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications.Symptoms include: global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual impairment, seizures, marked hypotonia (floppiness), hearing and/or vision impairment, difficulty in feeding and oesophageal reflux, congenital heart defects, apnoea, prominent high forehead, coarse facial features as child gets older, broad nasal bridge, streaks or patches of lighter or darker skin, sparse hair or bald patches, high arched or cleft palate, shorter arms and legs, disproportionate to the body and extra nipples.", "ref": "Baby boy Malakai suffers rare medical condition Pallister Killian Syndrome..

Leading psychologist Jo Lamble told Daily Mail Australia that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders.Scroll down for video Life-long struggle with the truth: Belle Gibson sensationally admitted that her terminal cancer was a lie in an interview with the Australian Women's WeeklyLamble has not treated Gibson personally but said, in her professional opinion, she believes Gibson could be displaying signs of both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder.Lack of remorse is a common trait seen in those with anti-social personalities, Lamble says.'A lack of remorse definitely fits in. It's like - you do what you need to do to get what you want,' she said. 'So if they need money they will commit fraudulent acts and steal, for example.'While other experts suggested to AWW that she could be suffering Munchhausen Syndrome, Lamble believes this isn't likely to be the case for Gibson. Changing times: 'In the past, a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand,' says Lamble'With Munchhausen, they normally don't just lie, they go much further to be sick.'While they definitely fake illness, they also self-harm and don't normally do it for money purposes, they do it for attention,' she said.'For example, they will go to lots of different doctors and shop around until someone believes their symptoms. They also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves, then ask, \"what's wrong with me?'''So I think in this particular case,  she's made up a story for fame, fortune, signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism,' added Lamble.Another common trait shared by narcissists is that sufferers are often very charismatic.'A lack or remorse definitely fits in... you do want you need to do to get what you want': Leading psychologist Jo Lamble says that Gibson's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune. They love to believe they are special and need all this admiration and attention,' the psychologist said.Lamble says this can often be a sign of neglect. This fits with Gibson's account of a troubled childhood - she was quoted in the Women's Weekly saying she had to bring herself up - doing the dishes and cooking her own food from a very young age, for example.According to Lamble, the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are... 1. They deceive and lie2. They lack remorse3. They can be  impulsive and irresponsible4. They don't respect the law5. They don't mind if they hurt family and friends, anyone is open to being deceived6. They are very charming and charismatic7. They have a certain attractiveness and draw people in8. They show a real interest in people9. Passionate about things 'Neglect can lead someone to develop really unhealthy strategies to seek the love and attention they missed out on,' says Lamble.'In the past, a need for love and attention may have emerged in less dangerous ways  - a lie here, a lie there - but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand.'Social media has become the perfect way to gain that, we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers -  let alone hero worship, worldwide fans and book deals,' she said.'I worry about future generations with things like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and people constantly needing excessive praise.' Lamble says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading.'Everyone laughs about Dr Google and how if you have some condition you should see an expert but that goes for all these self styled gurus in anything.'We might want to buy into a story, it's very appealing for people to love somebody who can turn something around and survive and particularly so if they are very marketable but any idolisation of someone isn't healthy.'With massive followings and a glamorous story, young minds will follow that and believe it. Our poor doctors must have people coming in every day and people saying this is what I'm doing and why. Let's look at the science,' she said. 'They love to believe they are special': 'Narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity, wanting fame and fortune, says psychologist Jo Lamble (pictured left). She believes Belle Gibson (pictured right) may suffer from a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder.Lamble also believes that Gibson could struggle to change without help. 'She might change her name and come up with some other scheme unless she shows genuine remorse, seeks help, and develops some insight. With what she is displaying, the prognosis is quite poor.'According to the interview, Gibson's new management will be organising for a psychologist to see her.", "ref": "Wellness guru and app developer Belle Gibson lied about having cancer..

I raised you and sent you to school. Without money I could not have gotten you an education.\"A widow at just 21, Dahou was forced to fend for herself in Egypt's patriarchal south, where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living. Even in recent years, women make up barely 24% of Egypt's workforce, according to the World Bank.\"It is considered wrong that I dressed as a man but no one can judge. Not you or anyone else. Only God can judge me,\" Dahou said, \"People talked but I said I decided to be a man so I can take care of my small daughter.\"The breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters, the equivalent of a few cents, until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit.  She found a place for her wooden box, painted with red hearts and the Egyptian flag, alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community.\"If it wasn't for my mother, I would have been on the streets\" Houda, her daughter, told TV host Mona al-Shazly through tears. \"Honestly I would have been in the streets. I did not find a home except with my mother. And even today my children rely on her.\"The years of sun and sand weathered and darkened Dahou's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man. Her only child, Houda, eventually married and had two children of her own.Through the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day, a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes.  After her interview on CBC television, the governor of Luxor province offered Dahou a kiosk and a cash advance. The maverick had one requirement- she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire.\"Even if I die, I will not take it off,\" Dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a TV camera, \"When I had to dress in a woman's jalabiya when I went to Cairo I felt suffocated. No, I thank God. I don't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter.\"Now the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman. Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, crowned her as one of Egypt's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month.\"If I was really a man, I would not have done this,\" Dahou told her daughter, \"I would have gotten remarried. I would have left you who knows where. You would have been treated without dignity or left homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.\"", "ref": "Sissa Abu Dahou recently was honored as one of Egypt's ideal mothers..

Don was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacksDespite considerable damage, Don escaped unhurt \u2013 but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things. Traffic Scotland tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold-ups 'due to a dog taking control of tractor', adding: 'Nope, not joking.' Appropriately, they couldn't resist the hashtag: '#maycausetailbacks'.Observers and Twitter commentators joined the pun fun by speculating: 'Police investigating \u2013 so far no leads'; or the inevitable: 'This is barking.' The incident happened at junction 13 of the M74, near Abington in South Lanarkshire.Sheep farmer Tom Hamilton was travelling across a field in the John Deere Gator farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds.Behind the wheel: Don leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire during rush hourThe vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the M74 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrowMoments after he got out of the vehicle, it took off with Don at the wheel. Safely back at nearby Kirkton Farm yesterday with Don at his side, Mr Hamilton explained: 'I was sorting out one of the lambs and hadn't put the brake on.'When I turned around I saw it racing towards the motorway. I ran after it but I couldn't catch up.' Traffic Scotland tweeted the news that a dog had 'taken control of a tractor' before adding, 'nope, not joking'Officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and Don was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby Kirkton FarmRemarkably, drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt, and none was hurt. Nor did the black and white border collie (a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience) panic or flee in terror. 'He didn't even bark,' Mr Hamilton said. Police said Don had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls.'So far people seem to find it amusing,' Mr Hamilton said. 'But I think Don's driving days are over.' Monty, a giant schnauzer cross, was pictured driving a mini down a race track in New Zealand in 2012", "ref": "The bizarre incident happened on M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire..

There will be quite a few friends prominent in British tennis \u2014 aside from anything Kim's father Nigel has been one of the country's leading coaches \u2014 but with the Monte Carlo Open beginning next Monday the bigger international names were always going to be otherwise engaged.Murray and Djokovic pose for a photograph prior to the mens final during the Miami OpenDjokovic holds the winners trophy after defeating Murray in the final of the Miami OpenIn fact the only non-British player likely to attend is Jean-Julien Rojer, a doubles specialist from the Dutch Antilles who has a base in Miami.'Jules lives there and I spend quite a lot of time with him. Tim (Henman) will be coming. James Ward, Jamie Delgado (longstanding British player and coach). 'We invited Kyle Edmund but he can't make it because he's playing,' said Murray, who confirmed the couple will not cash in on photography rights to any magazines.Other tennis guests include coach Amelie Mauresmo, former assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and two of his three best men, brother Jamie and former Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins. The third is Carlos Mier, a friend from his days at the Barcelona tennis academy he attended.Kim Sears fiancee of Murray  watches him in action against Djokovic in the fierce Miami sun'Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past and people that we see ourselves spending time with in the future. That's how we came up with the list,' said Murray.Rather than asking for wedding gifts, the couple have requested that guests make a donation to charities they support such as UNICEF and the World Wildlife Fund.'I'm going to go up to Scotland early and spend time with my family for a couple of days. I'm not going to hit any balls this week. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up.World No 3 Murray is set to marry his fiancee Sears in Dunblane next Saturday'Kim has pretty much controlled most of the important things and I've tried to help when she's asked. I haven't been overly involved but there's things I enjoy doing, I did all the food and cake tasting which I actually loved.'There will not be any honeymoon until later in the year. In the middle of next week Murray will head to Barcelona to train with incoming assistant coach, former Swedish player Jonas Bjorkman, before resuming his tournament schedule the week after that in Munich.Another change in the new rankings on Monday was Spaniard Rafael Nadal moving down to No 5.", "ref": "Tournament performances have restored andy Murray to World No 3  ..

Ben Flower's two brutal punches on Lance Hohaia, which led to the dismissal of the Wigan prop inside two minutes, fit that description. CLICK HERE to read Martha Kelner's full Super League Grand Final report  Wigan coach Shaun Wane told a news conference at the DW Stadium on Tuesday that he will throw Flower straight back in, almost certainly from the bench, and expects him to be just as physical.'I hope he's a bit more aggressive and a bit stronger and a bit fitter,' Wane said of Flower, who underwent knee surgery during his enforced lay-off.'He's without a doubt one of the best front rowers in the comp and that's we want. We need a Ben Flower in our team. He's dynamic, just what I like, he runs the ball hard and he's uncompromising. He's perfect for me.Flower falls on Hohaia after first punching the New Zealand international to the ground Referee Phil Bentham was given no choice but to make Flower the first player sent off in a grand final'I'll be telling him to go as hard as he can, run as hard as you can, hit as hard as you can and just carry on from where you left off because bear in mind in the play-off games last year he was one of the best. I want him back to that form as quickly as possible.'Flower, who was fined 50 per cent of his wages during his ban and has been coaching local juniors as part of the punishment handed out by his club, is ready to 'rip in', according to Wane.'He's in a very, very good state of mind,' the coach said. 'He's very strong and he's trained really well. I can't wait to put him in. I'm really looking forward to it. I've been itching for this game to come and he'll get a chance. 'He just wants to get back to what he's paid to do, playing rugby and being one of the best middles in the competition.'He's had a long pre-season and he's dying to rip in.'Flower's second punch (left) became the focal point of the all-in brawl which broke out in the first three minutesA bloodied Hohaia is helped from the field - he received a one-match ban for the forearm that sparked the fightWane says Flower is in a 'very good state of mind' after a long enforced pre-seasonWane will bring Flower straight back into the Warriors line-up, almost certainly from the benchMeanwhile, Wane has denied that Wigan are close to finalising the return of England full-back Sam Tomkins.The former Man of Steel has been granted a release from the last year of his three-year contract with New Zealand Warriors after becoming homesick and it is thought he is heading back to the Warriors, who retained first option on his services.'He's one of the best players in the world and we're always interested in the best players but I've been told nothing,' Wane said.'Unless I get a phone call today telling me anything different, I'm just cracking on preparing for Warrington and Wakefield.'", "ref": "Ben Flower was suspended for six month after Grand Final red card..

{"i": "be50bd56517bf4240402fbdeadaffd7f705e8d9a", "src": "Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside.While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling's interview didn't go down well at all.It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn't come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I'm hoping that that wasn't the whole point, as we've seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before.The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: 'let him go'. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money's worth!Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan RodgersSterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contractSterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal It's always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there's a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout.Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the \u00a3100,000-a-week contract he's turned down.But it's only that: potential. At present, he's arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he's also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form.He hasn't been great recently and was awful against Man Utd.Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania  And while I'd be willing to see the club give him \u00a3100k a week \u2013 possibly \u00a3120k a week - the club shouldn't do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club.Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I'm sure the club will handle it the way they have before.Frustration over Sterling's situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he's welcome to.Personally, I don't like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City).Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester UnitedLiverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the clubIf Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans But if he does end up going, he's worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential.At the moment, we've seen it in fits and starts but even so, he's easily worth \u00a325-30 million. If I was FSG, I'd hold any interested club to ransom, though \u2013 double it.But a move to Arsenal wouldn't go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there's little Arsenal can offer that we can't.Sure, they're more financially stable but what \u2013 in terms of trophies \u2013 do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years?Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contractI think we're somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else.People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different.Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren't offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world.Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he's going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won't happen at Arsenal.It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.You can read more from Live4Liverpool HERE and follow the Twitter account HERE", "ref": "Raheem Sterling said he was not ready to sign a new Liverpool contract..

One officer is also present when Slager picks up an object - allegedly his Taser - and puts it near Scott's body.Scroll down for video Questions: Officer Clarence Haberdashem searches Walter Scott's handcuffed body in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He later told colleagues that he administered CPRScott's father said of the incident: 'It would have never come to light [had video not emerged]. They would have swept it under the rug, like they did with many others.' Slager's former attorney had initially claimed that the officer fired on Scott during a struggle for his Taser and had felt threatened. 'When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser \u2014 as trained by the department \u2014 and then a struggle ensued,' David Aylor said. 'The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. [He] felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.'On Wednesday North Charleston Mayor Keith Sumney refused to answer a question on Slager's fellow officers' culpability, saying it would be addressed in the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division [SLED] investigation.There are also questions over discrepancies between responding officers' version of events in an internal incident report and what the witness video shows. It is not known what accounts those officers gave to the subsequent SLED investigation. The video of the shooting shows Officer Clarence Haberdasham was the first to arrive on scene as Scott lay handcuffed on the ground. As Haberdasham arrives, Slager runs back to position where he fired the fatal shots and appears to retrieve a dark object - claimed to be his Taser - and places it next to Scott's body.Haberdasham dons a pair of blue gloves, checks Scott's pulse, goes through his pockets and speaks on his radio and then walks away.Radio records show that an officer reported that Scott had gunshot wounds to the chest and right side and was 'unresponsive'. He later added that the vicitm had wounds to the back. Both Slager and Haberdasham stand over Scott's body, which remains handcuffed and face down.The same officer's account of events as reported in the NCPD incident report obtained by BuzzFeed is two sentences. The second reads: 'I attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to get to the victim faster.' Aftermath: Officer Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance POLICE VERSION Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday.He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light.He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager.The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement.According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott.At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said.He added that his actions were in line with procedure.Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.'His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim.  WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWSSlager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back.The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser.Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body.As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back.The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse.A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid.They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. The report is signed off by Sergeant James Gann. He states: 'I arrived on scene and observed that Officer Haberdasham was administering first aid to the driver. I exited my vehicle and assisted Officer Haberdasham with first aid and CPR to the driver.' He says they continued to give CPR until EMS arrived and Scott was pronounced dead. There is no evidence in Feidin Santana's video that Scott received CPR. A second video of the scene shows two other police officers arriving at the scene and getting out a medical kit. But they do not give CPR. Six other officers' version of what happened after the shooting is recorded in the incident report. They were: R. Terrell, J Bariss, M Cooper, R Killin, B Williams, and Sgt Webb. They all say that they heard Slager's call for help and arrived at the scene later. Gann says the crime scene was handed over to SLED, who then concluded their crime scene investigation that day. Edward Bryant III, president of the North Charleston NAACP, also told the Los Angeles Times that he suspects North Charleston cops have covered up other shootings. He said; 'This incident fits a pattern of abuse that has gone on for years. There is a code of conduct to cover their behinds. We call it Code Blue.'Marc Moria, President of the president of the National Urban League, told the Washington Post: 'But for this video, this would have been another coverup, another fabrication, another lie told by a police officer when the police officer was clearly in the wrong.'The discrepancies were also discussed on MSNBC's Morning Joe this morning. Host Joe Scarborough said: 'That cop is two feet away when he dropped the taser next to the dead body. I'm sorry, what cop is okay with that?'Mika Brzezinski added: 'There should be more charges'  After Officer Michael Slager was charged with murder on Tuesday and terminated from the North Charleston Police on Wednesday, his department released his personnel file. Some 100 pages including his job application, training records, firearm test scores and work appraisals were published online. Among the details were that Slager had graduated from Lenape High School in Medford, N.J, in 2001 and was a waiter at an Italian restaurant before he joined the U.S. Coast Guard in 2003. He spent six years with the Coast Guard working as a mechanic and engineer and then became involved in security on board vessels. He was hired by the North Charleston Police Department in December 2009 and attended the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy for a nine-week training course. Major Florence McCants told Yahoo News that Slager 'didn't create any issues nor was he an award winner in any of the categories'. Slager also took course in first-aid and use of a Taser, according to his personnel records.", "ref": "Growing questions over the conduct of Michael Slager's fellow officers.. Few questions appear to have been initially raised about  Slager's account of a struggle.. Other discrepancies between witness video and internal Police report .. Authorities refuse to day if any other officers will be disciplined.. Civil rights leaders say of Slager's actions 'this would have been another cover up'", "scores": {"sup4_t0.7": {"overall": 2.0, "accuracy": 2.0, "coverage": 3.0, "coherence": 7.0, "bert_score_p":

She is suing the responding deputies for stripping her daughter nearly naked and taking photosLoss: Jessica Mejia, 20, was killed when her drunk ex-boyfriend smashed their car into a pole in 2009The young woman had been wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and high-heeled shoes but was photographed wearing just her lower undergarment, according to the Chicago Tribune.By doing so, the deputies intentionally caused emotional distress to the victim's family, they say.'This was a young lady that just died and was treated with less dignity than a deer carcass you find on the side of the road,' family attorney Don Perry told the Tribune. Mrs Mejia added that the photos had left her feeling 'violated' and she accused the deputies' actions of perpetuating  false rumors that the car had crashed because her daughter was on top of Sord.'(People) think my daughter died from having sex, not from somebody being drunk and killing her,' the heartbroken mother told the Tribune.'By the time everybody else got to the scene... she was partially naked because they made her naked. So the rumors, and the allegations... they made it believable.'But the sheriff's office insisted that it took the photographs at the scene in order to gather evidence that ultimately helped to convict Sord. They called the images 'standard operating procedure'.Locked up: Nicholas Sord, left, was sentenced to 56 months in prison for the deadly crash. Mejia's family filed a lawsuit against the sheriff's office for taking the photos and the trial will begin next week'The family suffered an unimaginable loss, and the crime scene photos were taken as our officers investigated this crime and were instrumental in securing a conviction against the person responsible for this tragic death,' spokeswoman Cara Smith said. 'In no way were these photos intended to cause harm to the family.' Sord, whose blood alcohol level was .236 per cent when he smashed his Mercedes SUV into a pole, pleaded guilty to drunken driving last fall and was sentenced to 56 months in prison.Sord was a business partner with former Chicago Blackhawks player Denis Savard and is the son of Bryan Sord, a prominent developer and restaurateur.He and Mejia had dated but had broken up months before the crash. Mejia was studying psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago when she died.", "ref": "Jessica Mejia, 20, died when her drunk ex-boyfriend smashed their car into a pole in Cook County, Illinois in December 2009..

'If it was easy, you wouldn't lose 3-1 at home to Monaco. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. It's not easy to defend.'Jose Mourinho hit back at Arsene Wenger during his pre-match press conference on FridayArsene Wenger (left) and Mourinho have over a decade of history in the Premier League Arsene Wenger will be sick of the sight of Didier Drogba. He has scored 13 times for Chelsea against Arsenal, averaging a goal every 87 minutes.Monaco, ouch.Mourinho is not afraid to hit where it hurts. Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, but they were downright awful at home to Monaco.They conceded three and they crashed out of the Champions League. It was a blemish to support the theory that Arsenal are fine until the pressure is on.When Chelsea crashed out of Europe they were, as usual, snarling and disputing every decision.'Maybe you will discover the Chelsea team are completely offensive and we are defensive for 90 minutes,' said Wenger, resorting to sarcasm as he assessed the clash at the Emirates on Sunday.'Our job is to win football games and that's what they've done in recent games. What's important for me is to do what it takes to win the game. It's easy to defend, if we have to defend then we will defend.'It is the issue at the heart of this ideological clash. On one side Wenger, committed to the romance of attractive football. On the other Mourinho, doing what it takes to win even if it proves ugly, stacking up the trophies. Beat Arsenal and Leicester, on Wednesday, and he will clinch the title.Arsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco in the Champions League - a result which Mourinho mentioned to the mediaPrince Albert of Monaco celebrates with the away fans after the full-time whistle at the EmiratesWenger looks dejected as he stands on the touchline during the Gunners' Champions League defeatThe challenge for Wenger is next season. Can he produce a team fit to fight for the title once again?'We have played amazingly well for most of the season,' said Mourinho. 'In the last period we have been more strategic and less artistic because we had injuries and suspensions and lost the balance of our team.'But we are having results. It is a great feeling to deal with the difficult moment in a strategic way. When you are lost at sea and you have no boat, you must survive. You build a raft.' Diego Costa's injuries and suspensions were Chelsea's shipwreck. Without his muscular spearhead, the balance was lost and it is three months since his team won by more than one goal.Still they win, taking six points from their last two games \u2014 against QPR and Manchester United \u2014 while recording a total of only three shots on target. They are, as Wenger says, efficient. 'We are top since day one,' said Mourinho. 'We are second in terms of goals scored. We are second best for goals conceded, the team with fewest defeats.Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (second from left) scores against Manchester United last time outHazard scored the only goal of the game against United to take Chelsea a step closer to the league titleA TV camera gets a close-up of the goalscorer as Hazard celebrates with Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge'We have some of the best goals of the season, not individual action or shots like Charlie Adam's from midfield, but spectacular team goals.'So, if we win the Premier League, we did everything right. It will be a great achievement. Looking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, it means a lot.'It will be the first title in five years at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal have not won it since 2004, the year of Wenger's Invincibles and the year Mourinho first swept into London claiming to be the Special One.Since then, two famous clubs have been soaked in the contrasting views of two men. Arsenal are Wenger, after more than 18 years of his leadership, and Chelsea have been Mourinho for more than a decade \u2014 even during his six-year absence.Mourinho (right) and Wenger have had plenty of touchline battles during their managerial careersThe pair rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capitalArsenal's Emmanuel Eboue is restrained by Chelsea boss Mourinho during the 2007 League Cup finalThey rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital.For many years, Wenger pursued Chelsea for 'financial doping' and, more recently, their tactical style, while Mourinho gorged on Arsenal's nine years with neither a trophy nor a managerial change.Mourinho has never lost to Wenger, a record which clearly eats away at the Frenchman, who exploded on the touchline at Stamford Bridge, in October, and shoved the Chelsea manager in the chest.There has been no apology. 'No, but I don't need that,' shrugged Mourinho, who remains incredulous that Wenger was not disciplined by the FA. Does he feel it would have been different had the roles been reversed? 'I don't feel, I know,' he said.", "ref": "Chelsea can secure the League title if they beat Arsenal and Leicester.. Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger have had a decade of touchline battles..

Killed: Little Caesar was shot dead at the weekend after wandering off from his family's home in Ispheming in northern Michigan. He was killed by a DNR officer, who believed he was feralBeloved: Brandy Savelle (pictured) and Tony Gervasi have had Caesar as a pet for about two years, and had been trying to teach him to stay outdoors when he wandered offBFFs: Caesar and the family's pet dog got along famously, the couple saidSavelle continued: 'I just started screaming for him.'The incident became quite a big deal in the area, with announcements on Facebook quickly spreading and a page set up on Go Fund Me. A day later, a Natural Resources officer showed up at the couple's door.'We figured he had information so with excitement, Brandy answered the door asking if he knew anything about the pig,' Mr Gervasi said.'The man responded ''Actually, I am responsible for the missing pig\u2026''The officer explained that Caesar 'came out of the woods at me running at a trotting pace'.He said he 'felt threatened' so shot him.The officer maintained he believed the animal was feral.Scene: Mr Gervasi took this photo of the blood they found after following Caesar's tracks and put the photo on Facebook when the pig was still missing, which quickly spreadShot dead: The officer explained that Caesar 'came out of the woods at me running at a trotting pace' and that he shot the pig, believing he was a feral animalHarmless: The state is defending a Department of Natural Resources conservation officer who shot Caesar on the belief the pig was wildThe shooting also happened on state land.In such circumstances officers are permitted to shoot animals that can carry disease and/or damage property. Peter Wright, a law supervisor for the DNR, told WLUC-TV that the officer was just doing his job. He said the officer believed it was a feral pig, since it had no identifying marks to distinguish him as a pet.'I want to make it very clear that it's never ever, ever the department's position that we want to shoot people's pets,' said Wright. 'If he had any inkling it was a pet, he absolutely wouldn't have shot it.'Upsetting: The family are now trying to get Caesar's body in order to bury him, but have been told they can only take possession of his ashesBrandy Savelle and Tony Gervasi are now trying to get Caesar's body back.However they have been told they can only take possession of ashes.Ms Savelle is demanding that some sort of recourse comes out of the situation.'If it was that big of a mistake then we would like to see better training,' she said. 'Let's learn to identify not just pigs, but all pets.'", "ref": "Caesar went missing at the weekend from his owner's home in Ispheming..

She also suggested that single-sex boarding schools give pupils relief and protection from the 'highly sexualised world' and allow them to 'remain girls for longer.''My wide educational experience in both mixed and girls' schools has shown me clearly that girls are best served educationally in their teenage years in a boy-free work environment,' she said according to the Telegraph.Rhiannon Wilkinson, the head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire, pictured, claims a 'boy free' environment allows teenage girls to focus on their workShe added: 'In co-ed environments lots of girls when adolescence kicks want to be liked by boys not just for their intelligence and want to be popular with boys.But she said in all girl environments pupils are 'free from that,' according to the Telegraph.  Two years ago Scientists at Newcastle University found that girls really do mature faster than boys.They discovered that as the brain matures it begins to 'prune' information that is stored and focus on what is important.Tony Little, head at Eton College, has previously said that single sex schools allow children to retain their 'innocence' For girls this can happen as early as 10 years old, but for boys it can take until between 15 and 20 for the same. Tony Little, the head of Eton College, has also spoken of the benefits of single sex schools.He said they allow children to retain their 'innocence' and be 'themselves' for longer.'What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls,' he said, according to the BBC.Boys could also benefit from being taught separately. Statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university. Alun Jones, the first male president of the Girls' Schools Association, has previously called for teenage boys  to be taught in single sex classes in state schools. Mr Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: 'If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability.'The result is that boys don't put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better.'", "ref": "'boy free' environment stops Girls from being held back by opposite sex ..

A New York City bus driver running a route in Queens is facing possible termination after an unidentified commuter recorded him driving with papers in his handThe driver was seen with both hands on a piece of paper, believed to be a timetable for his route replacing the closed section of a subway, and driving the bus with his wrists and forearmsThe commuter who captured the distracted driving on a bus with only standing room said that the behavior occurred the entire time she was travelling 'He jeopardized the lives of everyone on that bus and anyone on the street,' the commuter said. The papers in his hand were likely timetables used to make sure he was stopping at all the correct junctures on Saturday evening,  the New York Post reported, citing a transit source.The bus was being used to replace part of a subway line closed for maintenance during the weekend.New York's Metro Transportation Authority, which runs the city's buses, said that 'bus operators are expected to have their full attention on safe operations at all times'.The driver has been taken out of passenger service while the agency investigates, and could face possible penalties including termination or retraining depending on his work history, according to a New York Post source.New York City adopted new laws last year as part of an effort to eliminate traffic accidents, such as the February 2014 crash between an city bus and a truck that careened into a building on 7th AvenueThis weekend's video comes as New York City has targeted speeding and reckless motorists in a bid to eliminate traffic deathsA  law pushed into law by Mayor Bill DeBlasio last August has increased penalties on drivers, including MTA employees, who hit pedestrians after failing to yield.Bus drivers have said they are under attack by the new regulations, and that accidents happen even when drivers are doing their jobs properly. At least nine pedestrians were killed by transportation authority buses last year, according to the New York Times.", "ref": "Bus driver in Queens seen highlighting  timetables as he drives with wrists..
