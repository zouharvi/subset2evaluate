Luis Suarez (9) has revealed that he once sneaked his way into the Nou Camp for a photographHe said: 'It was not the first time that I came to Barcelona, it was the second. I went past the official store and saw it, but I did not go in because I didn't have money to buy anything. 'I was already going with Sof\u00eda and I remember that I saw an open door and I told her: 'Let's go'. 'You're crazy'. 'Come, just one photo'. 'No, no'. 'Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go in'. I went in through the door that was open, she followed me and we started to run. 'We stood on the stairs and took a photo with all of the stadium behind us. I still haven't found the photo. Then we ran, and we were nervous. It was the only time that I had entered. My father-in-law managed to enter another time to see Argentina-Catalunya, on December 27.'

He said: 'Madrid were very interested in me, but my dream was always Barcelona. When I heard the name of Barca, I did not hesitate at any moment.'Arguably Suarez's most famous, yet controversial moment, when he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and being banned for four-months. 'The bite on Chiellini was the worst moment of my career,' he said. 'I let myself down, my country, my wife and my children. The bites were partly my fault and partly [due to] the provocation of Ivanovic and Chiellini. Now they continue provoking me, but now I go or speak well. I am more intelligent.'

The shocking letter, littered with expletives and exclamation marks told the mother that they were 'so over' the running commentary on her daughter's life.And while this may be a harsh reaction to her social obsession, social media expert Sarah-Jane Kurtini believes people need to more aware of their ramblings on the web. 'I think people just have this inbuilt need to share,' Ms Kuritini told Daily Mail Australia. Know your privacy settingsIt is amazing how many parents leave on their Instagram location settings. Set your location settings to off if you do not want people to be able to figure out where you and your children live. Only share with people who careAsk yourself if all the people you're sharing your photos with really want to see them and will they protect them in a way you would.  Explore private social networksPrivate social networks offer a secure way to share the pictures of your children with your family and friends. Don't take any digital photosUltimately the only way to be 100 per cent sure that you don't  have a digital footprint is not to have any digital photos taken but this isn't a road the vast majority of people want to go down. 'In a lot of cases it probably is fine but when you're giving away exactly where your family life is taking place, there's a risk and it's probably more sensible not to do it.'People have started to be less self-aware and when everything happens they put it online. What they don't think about is who they're sharing it with.'While Ms Kurtini said that she understands why people can get fed up of people oversharing their kids' lives on social media sites, she was disturbed at the letter Ms Ruthven received from her so-called friends. 'Everyone came out in support of her which they should have done because bullying shouldn't be tolerated and that letter was horrific,' she said. Too many posts: Jade Ruthven, 33, pictured with Addison, has been sharing endless pictures and statuses about her baby daughter on Facebook'No one has come out and said that the limit is one baby photo a week or one a month, but everyone seems to know when someone has stepped over the mark.'The entrepreneur said it's hard for people to know where the line stops when it comes to posting personal details online. While a person may thrive off 'checking in' at the city's fanciest restaurant or showing friends what they're missing at the local pub, they can't treat their children's photos in the same way and should not look for the same social validation. 'One of the scary things about social media is how it makes you check yourself the whole time and second guess whether people will receive it well and it can make new mums quite anxious,' Ms Kurtini said. Harsh words: The letter was sent to an 'baby spamming' mother after the author got fed up with the amount of pictures and statuses she was writing on Facebook about her child - and it has now been shared worldwide'As soon as your friends like it you're just putting it into a new feed and it's not clear where they're going.' Ms Kurtini, who is the co-founder of Tinybeans, a private social media network for families said that although parents are worried about what the dangers of sharing on social media are, they choose to ignore the warnings. In a recent survey of social media awareness, conducted by the University of Michigan, over 74 per cent of respondents claimed they had doubts about posting baby images on the web, however they followed the crowd and did it anyway.Worryingly, 51 per cent of parents offer up personal information alongside their photos that could identify a child's location and 27 per cent have shared inappropriate pictures of their baby. They also found that more than half of mothers and one-third of fathers discuss child health and parenting on social media - and nearly three quarters of parents saying social media makes them feel less alone.'A thing we always say is to share with those who care and don't waste your precious family moments on people who don't want to see them,' she said. Social validation: Nearly 70 percent of parents said they use social media to get advice from other more experienced parents and 62 % said it helped them worry less'The people I share with would never share them on and would protect them as much as I would.Ms Kurtini believes the message has yet to sink in with parents who continually post inappropriate snaps on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and even tag their location in the photos. Ms Kurtini believes enabling the geographical location to appear on the picture is the most worrying trend of them all. A recent study found when sharing parenting advice on social media, common topics included :Getting kids to sleep (28%)Nutrition and eating tips (26%)Discipline (19%)Daycare/preschool (17%) Behaviour problems (13%)'The scary thing is that they don't know it's happening,' she said. 'I know my privacy setting so I know that level of comfort with what I'm going to share but it looks like people don't.  Especially on photo-sharing site Instagram, doting parents are sometimes inadvertently declaring their whereabouts and over time it can become clear exactly where they live. Ms Kurtini said she has spoken to mummy bloggers and celebrities who are horrified to learn that their photos can be tracked back to their home address just by the switch of one button. 'If you leave your location settings on, there's a location tag and you can hit it and the majority of people add their photos at home so you can pretty much guess where they live,' she said. 'It terrifies me.'I keep seeing people doing it and I want to email them saying stop it, especially high profile people.'Stories of oversharing gone wrong have been rampant in the news, with one of the most extreme examples including a phenomenon called 'digital kidnapping' reported on earlier this year.Parents were shocked to learn that strangers were 'stealing' their kids' online photos and re-sharing them as if the children were their own.Sand selfie: Despite parents being concerned over their privacy settings on social media sites, they continue to post photos online, sometimes giving away their geographical location In other cases, children's photos have become the target of cruel jokes and cyber bullying. Among the most notorious cases in recent years was that of a Facebook group that made fun of 'ugly' babies.'Many people are often lulled into a false sense of security thanks to the familiarity of social media and don't realise that the images or stories they post of their children may in fact be shared with a broader audience,' Ms Kurtini said. 'Parents need to approach their child's digital footprint mindfully.'The best way to do this is to know your privacy settings inside out. In many instances, it can take only a matter of mere seconds to deduce the road someone lives on from their social media post. Other precautions to take are to only share your snaps with people you trust and use a personal, private social media network.", "ref": " There has been a rise in 'sharenting' - sharing photos of children online.

He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep.

The heavens are likely to open again around 5pm.Andy's mother Judy discussed the bad weather on social media, initially tweeting: 'Hailstones. Marvellous,' and then a few hours later: 'Snowing. White wedding.'Fans who have set up camp outside the church have found themselves battling the elements this morning as they were battered by wind, rain and sleet in short succession. Ross Hutchins (left) was a guest at the ceremony, as was former British No 1 Tim Henman and his wifeHowever the wet weather showed no sign of dampening the spirits of the crowds outside the cathedral.Brenda Watson travelled from Ochiltree in Ayrshire with her friend to join in the celebrations.She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.'Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.'No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim SearsHundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe.Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night.Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for \u00a31.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim SearsFlorists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees.Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years.The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe.Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier.Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret.Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear.Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral.The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association.They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship.Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon.He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November.Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the weddingMurray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well.'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together.'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.'Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal.Bride-to-be Kim, 27, wore skinny black jeans, a leather jacket and blue scarf as the final preparations were made for their big day. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple wellGraham Fleming puts up bunting in Dunblane's high street as shops  decorate their fronts in support of local boy Andy Perhaps saving her legs for walking in heels tomorrow, she today stayed casual in red flats.Meanwhile, a smiling Andy was equally casual in jeans and trainers as he made his way into the cathedral where he will make his vows this weekend. With an Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon title under his belt, Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well.The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have in recent times to a royal wedding'.Reverend Colin Renwick said he expects Britain's top tennis star and his fiancee, Kim Sears, will be as 'nervous and as excited as any couple getting married'.The minister, who has been tight-lipped in recent weeks, said he was 'excited' to be part of the service, as final touches were added to the venue.

Pictured is an interior view of a Google self-driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to 'see' the road. Google is believed to be working on technology for self-driving cabs, but hasn't revealed detailsThe study, by Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  used data from Lisbon in Portugal.By plugging the data into a computer model, they simulated how such self-driving, communal cabs would affect traffic. Even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent.The authors said replacing personal cars with self-driving cabs would also free valuable real estate currently used for public parking - equivalent to over 200 football pitches in Lisbon's case.Major technology firms are already banking on self-driving taxis to be the future of transportation.Even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent. In this image is one Google's autonomous vehicles pictured with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt (left) and  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx (right)Last year, for instance, ride-sharing service Uber said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles.CEO Travis Kalanick admitted the technology would keep costs down, and these savings could then be passed on to its customers.Corey Clothier, who is co-ordinating the trials told DailyMail.com that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots.'Systems will fail, people's judgements will fail,' he said. 'If someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle, if it can't stop, it can't stop.'A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars.Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly.However, many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans. Google has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on 'defensive driving' styles.They have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles 'body language' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are. Speaking at the Code Conference in California, Kalanick said: 'The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car - you're paying for the other dude in the car.'When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.'Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (\u00a3170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. But last month unnamed source told Bloomberg that Google is preparing to offer its own taxi service, and it was likely to use its driverless cars. The report said that Google had told Uber's board of this possibility, and executives had seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app, currently being used by employees.While driverless taxis are still some way off from becoming a reality, a separate report last month found they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses.Ten US cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year, with the first being unveiled in Tampa Bay, Florida in the spring.Meanwhile, trials will launch in another 12 to 20 US locations by the end of next year, which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 US cities by 2017.As well as the US, the UK will also be trialing the vehicles in Greenwich as part of the $9 million project called Gateway, shuttling people to the O2 Arena.The finding comes amid reports that companies such as Google and Uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis Some will be on the roads where it's legal,' Corey Clothier, a strategist Comet LLC, who is running the trials told DailyMail.com.Passengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands.A combination of radar, lasers gives the car a 360-degree 'view', with sensors linked to computer software able to 'see' and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.'It's interesting to see people's reactions', said Clothier. 'Very few are nervous, or noticeably nervous. 'We've had interesting reactions from non-riders too. We were in the Silicon Valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen.''The vehicles stopped. We've never had an accident.'Major technology firms are already banking on self-driving taxis to be the future of transportation.

Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street.\"1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,\" the statement said.The statement continued, \"A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision.\"Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement.The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, \"Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody.\"Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said.Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a \"bloody trail of handprints\" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland \"almost landed right next to the club,\" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club.The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said.A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said.Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said.Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said.\"We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,\" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. \"We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them.\"The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said.Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey.The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital.\"We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,\" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement.Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, \"We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait.\"The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident.\"We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,\" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email.Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night.The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m.Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC.There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported.Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23.Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side.Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported.The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention.CNN's Laura Ly, Jason Durand and Jill Martin contributed to this report.", "ref": " Hawks say neither Thabo Sefolosha nor Pero Antic will play Wednesday against Brooklyn.

'My concern is we still have the Ebola crisis in Africa and any one of those people who were coming in via Madrid could have been travelling from places where potentially Ebola could have been passed on,' he added. 'And also there is the fact that anybody is walking into the country. You are told that your taxes go to protecting UK borders.' Border Force  claim that a number of passengers were checked by officers on their arrival into Manchester Airport.The agency said that anyone not assessed at the airport had been subsequently checked on their systems.Far from being a one-off, a former airport worker, who would not be named, claimed arriving passengers are frequently unchecked.He even claimed that on one occasion,the border agent manning the passport kiosk and making decisions on passenger entry was actually an illegal immigrant.Holidaymakers were not asked for documents but were allowed to walk through a deserted passport control uncheckedSchoolteacher Clinton Lakin, 46, called the lack of security ludicrous and said 'Every passenger on that plane walked through without a passport check in Britain.'The only passport check was done at Madrid Airport'Mr Lakin, from Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, called the lack of security  'ludicrous.''If your plane is delayed and it is that time of night and the airport is closed, then you can just walk into the country, anybody, 130 people.'Nobody was there, no checks were made. It just seems ludicrous.''I did not see a single member of airport staff once we got into the building until we got through to where Costa Coffee is in the arrivals.'I wanted to report to somebody in the airport that there had been this breach of security.' Manchester Airport said it was down to the airline or its handling agent to inform UK Border Force of their arrivals.  But  Ryanair said the airline had attempted to update security at the airport of the plane's arrival at its usual 30-minute intervals but had been unable to do so due to a malfunction of the airport's operating systems.Deserted: Passengers are left to make their own way out of the empty terminal at Manchester AirportMr Lakin claimed he did not see a 'single member of airport staff' until he got through to the arrivals loungeA spokesman said: 'All regular operating procedures were followed and the flight times were updated approximately every 30 minutes.'There appears to have been a malfunction in the airport's system, which caused incorrect flight information to be published, and subsequently resulted in this issue at border control. We have asked Manchester Airport to look into this matter and ensure it does not recur.' However, the airport said its system 'operated as normal on the night in question.'The Home Office confirmed the Border Force Agency is investigating the incident but added it was the legal responsibility of the airline or handling company to advise them when inbound flights arrive and to present the passengers to their officers.'We are currently carrying out an investigation into this incident,' a spokesman added.A Manchester Airport spokesman said: 'It is the responsibility of an airline's handling agent to notify UK Border Force about arrivals from outside of the UK - not the airport.'By them doing this in advance of a flight's arrival, ensures the relevant UKBF staff is in place to handle the immigration process.'We are continuing to work with our partners to investigate the situation but can confirm the airport's system operated as normal on the night in question.'

{"i": "0ae2b322a93bf193821727c3a7fdf8d3f44d1019", "src": "Protests are gaining steam in Baltimore after a man died from a devastating injury he allegedly suffered while in police custody.Demonstrators have vowed they'll keep taking to the streets until they get justice. To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why.But it seems like the questions in the controversial case just keep growing.Protesters rallied at Baltimore City Hall on Thursday, and another march is planned for Saturday. Here's a look at key issues protesters are asking about:Police say when Gray saw police on April 12, he started running. Within minutes, they caught up with him and arrested him after finding a knife in his pocket.Protesters have echoed the claims of the Gray family's attorney, who argues that police didn't have any probable cause to pursue him, but chased him for \"running while black.\"Baltimore Police union attorney Michael Davey told reporters Wednesday that officers had every right to chase Gray.\"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,\" he said. \"In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\"An autopsy says Gray died from a severe spinal cord injury. His family says his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and later died.Police say they spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a \"wagon\" to transport him in less than four minutes.The transport van left with Gray about 11 minutes afterward, police said, and another 30 minutes passed before \"units request paramedics to the Western District to transport the suspect to an area hospital.\"Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody.Investigators still haven't said what happened inside the van.Union officials from the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle, but they don't know what.Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN affiliate WJZ that another prisoner inside the van said he didn't see any harm done to Gray.\"What he has said is that he heard Freddie thrashing about,\" Batts said. \"The driver didn't drive erratically, wasn't slamming on breaks, wasn't turning corners fast or in an irrational way.\"Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday.\"They have completely cooperated with the investigation from Day 1,\" Davey told reporters.But details of what the officers said haven't been released yet by authorities.Neither have the officers' personnel records or photos. Police say doing that would violate the law.The lack of details a week and a half after the incident is fueling cries from the public, and the lawmakers who represent them. Protesters say police should be releasing what they know now.Baltimore Police officials say they're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing. And they say they plan to hand over details from the investigation to the State Attorney's Office next week.Some protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for Gray's death. Officials say an investigation is ongoing, and all  the officers involved have been suspended with pay. At this point, it isn't clear whether any charges will be filed.The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the case.The police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court.\"There is, at this time, no indication of any criminal activity whatsoever,\" the union's statement said, \"but our support will not waiver for any reason.\"Gray's case is getting a lot of attention. But protest organizers say it's emblematic of a broader problem.Some protesters say it's not the only time they've seen police brutality on the streets of their city.Long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over Gray's death, some of them had already been at city hall, voicing their concerns over other cases.\"Right now there's a lot of mistrust. They feel it's us versus them,\" Baltimore City Council President Jack Young said. \"It should not be that way and it needs to be fixed.\"According to the Baltimore Sun, the city has paid more than $5.7 million since 2011 for more than 100 cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing.Police didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement on Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly.\"Let us be clear, we completely disagree with this policy, as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but, rather, to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit.

The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checksAlthough the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU.Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating.However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons.ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduatingISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'.The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day.It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'.It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment.Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch.Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules.Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills.

On of the boy's relatives screamed at the suspect: 'I hope you die!'  Joshua Medrano, 6, who was a passenger in the sedan, was fatally injured. His mother, Cynthia, was hospitalized with a punctured lung and broken bones.Boudreaux was arrested at the scene after failing a field sobriety test.Three wrecks: The 34-year-old, who has a history of DUIs in Louisiana, is also accused of crashing into another car carrying a woman and a toddler Several hours earlier, according to police, the 34-year-old man struck and killed 61-year-old vagrant Leonard Batiste walking along Texas 5 Spur near the University of Houston.Investigators say the homeless man was mowed down at around 5.15pm Sunday but his body was not discovered until Monday afternoon. Boudreaux's entire bumper, complete with his license plate, was found nearby.Blaine Boudreaux also has been linked to a third collision that occurred about two hours before Batiste's death.The two-car crash took place in the 6600 block of Fannin Street and involved a mother and her 2-year-old child, who were taken to a hospital and later released.In that case, Boudreaux was issued a ticket by a police officer and allowed to leave the scene.After slamming into the elderly man on Texas 5 Spur, Boudreaux allegedly dozed off behind the wheel and didn't wake up until another driver honked at him to get his attention.That is when he ran the red light at the intersection of Lockwood and the East Freeway and slammed into Cynthia Medrano's black Honda, killing her son, according to officials.Joseph Rodriguez, the boy's stepfather, said little Joshua wanted to become a firefighter when he grew up.Rodriguez said the officer who stopped Boudreaux after the first accident involving the mother and toddler should have detained him instead of letting the man go.Prosecutor Alison Baimbridge told the Houston Chronicle investigators are now looking into that collision and resulting citation in light of Boudreaux's apparent intoxication about two hours.Cynthia Medrano, pictured here with her family, was driving Sunday evening with her young son in the passenger seat when police say Boudreaux ran a red light and plowed into her Honda CivicDoomed: Even though the 6-year-old was buckled in, he suffered fatal injuries and died upon arriving at a hospitalWhen questioned by police after his arrest, Boudreaux allegedly admitted that he had taken anti-depressants and a drug used to treat addiction to opiates before getting behind the wheel of his pickup truck Sunday afternoon.Blaine Boudreaux, a Catholic school dropout who moved to Houston in his late teens, has recently lost his home security business and allowed his pharmacy technician license to lapse, reported the Chronicle.During his arraignment Wednesday morning, prosecutors revealed that the suspect has multiple outstanding warrants for DUIs in Louisiana. In one case, he also had jumped bail.In light of these facts, his bond was set at $100,000 on each of the three counts, reported the station KTRK.Boudreaux's arraignment was attended by several members of Joshua Medrano's family who sobbed in court and showed Boudreaux the middle finger.One woman cried out 'I hope you die!' as the suspect clad in an orange jumpsuit was being led out of the courtroom.Shattered: Cynthia Medrano, pictured with Joshua and her husband, suffered a punctured lung and broken bones", "ref": " Blaine Boudreaux, 34, charged with intoxication manslaughter, intoxicated assault and failure to stop and render aid involving death .

{"i": "6132176f8d61e108f8ae9f3b010f69d722e4152f", "src": "The mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which began 100 years ago Friday, is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century, even though the word \"genocide\" did not exist at the time.The issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional, both for Armenians, who are descended from those killed, and for Turks, the heirs to the Ottomans. For both groups, the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts.Some Armenians feel their nationhood cannot be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged. Some Turks still view the Armenians as having been a threat to the Ottoman Empire in a time of war, and say many people of various ethnicities -- including Turks -- were killed in the chaos of war.In addition, some Turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations.So, what do we know about happened in those fateful days? Here are some answers:The Ottoman Turks, having recently entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were worried that Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire would offer wartime assistance to Russia. Russia had long coveted control of Constantinople (now Istanbul), which controlled access to the Black Sea -- and therefore access to Russia's only year-round seaports.Many historians agree that the number was about 2 million. However, victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million Armenians living in the Caucasus under Russian rule, some of whom were massacred by Ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through East Armenia and Azerbaijan.By 1914, Ottoman authorities were already portraying Armenians as a threat to the empire's security. Then, on the night of April 23-24, 1915, the authorities in Constantinople, the empire's capital, rounded up about 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders. Many of them ended up deported or assassinated.April 24, known as Red Sunday, is commemorated as Genocide Remembrance Day by Armenians around the world. Friday is the 100th anniversary of that day.This is a major point of contention. Estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923, with not all of the victims in the Ottoman Empire. But most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918, made by Ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million.Whether due to killings or forced deportation, the number of Armenians living in Turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922.Almost any way one can imagine.While the  death toll is in dispute, photographs from the era document some mass killings. Some show Ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads, others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt.The victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning, torture, gas, poison, disease and starvation. Children were reported to have been loaded into boats, taken out to sea and thrown overboard. Rape, too, was frequently reported.In addition, according to the website armenian-genocide.org, \"The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger.\"No. Genocide was not even a word at the time, much less a legally defined crime.The word \"genocide\" was invented in 1944 by a Polish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin to describe the Nazis' systematic attempt to eradicate Jews from Europe. He formed the word by combining the Greek word for race with the Latin word for killing.Genocide became a crime in 1948, when the United Nations approved the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The definition included acts meant \"to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\"Armenia, the Vatican, the European Parliament, France, Russia and Canada.

{"i": "8863420b34e2279ca7ab57f6a95ec18cc4b4c5af", "src": "Sunday, April 26. That is when it becomes real. The second act of Tony McCoy's life. On Saturday he will dismount from the bay gelding Box Office after the 4.25pm at Sandown Park \u2013 the Bet365 Handicap Hurdle \u2013 and it will begin. Perhaps it will not quite sink in, at first, amid the cheers and roars, the hoopla and a presentation from Ian Wright, an Arsenal hero, as befits McCoy's club allegiance.Yet the following morning, when McCoy awakes an ex-jockey, he will understand there are no more competitive rides, no more races, no more Cheltenhams or Aintrees or even modest little handicap hurdles to separate him from the field. Just entries in record books and the fact he will never have to put his hand in his pocket at any racetrack in Britain or Ireland to remind him of what was.AP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires after a successful careerTo date, McCoy has 4,357 winning memories. Eddie Arcaro had 4,779, including five Kentucky Derbys. He was known as The Master in American racing, comparable in his field to baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and golf's Jack Nicklaus. 'I liked being a celebrity, if I'm being honest,' Arcaro said. 'When a jockey retires he becomes just another little man.' Arcaro was retired 36 years before succumbing to liver cancer in 1997.It cannot be said that McCoy has courted celebrity, or that he will ever be regarded as a little man by racegoers, yet as he scurries to his new life, minus its thrills, spills and the snap of broken bones, one cannot help but ask: why? To be a jockey is to live a life of denial, early nights, early mornings, restraint at the dinner table, water at the bar, long, hot baths to sweat out the weight that, in McCoy's case, lowered his sperm count. His children were born through IVF treatment. Yet not one of McCoy's thoughts on retiring has centred greatly on the inconveniences or even the pain of injury. He doesn't now talk excitedly of lavish lunches or late nights, of never having to look at a fractured vertebrae via x-ray; there is no hint of the social whirl experienced by Sir Alex Ferguson on stepping down at Manchester United. McCoy will host a party at home on Sunday for family, friends and his closest racing colleagues, and the next day travel to the Punchestown festival with JP McManus, as a spectator.The rest of his retirement talk amounts to wishful thinking. McCoy simply reiterates he would still like to be riding. If he could ride in disguise for another three years he would do just that.McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friendsAnd why would he need a mask? That is the puzzle of McCoy's decision: the fear that appears to be at the heart of it. He is genuinely, unfathomably, unnerved by the thought of staying too long, of not going out a winner. True, Brian Clough was relegated in his final season at Nottingham Forest, Sugar Ray Leonard's last comeback of four ended in an early stoppage, Paul Gascoigne travelled to pitifully obscure outposts trying to cling on to what remained of his professional career. Yet, another year of McCoy? Another year of the man who currently leads the Jump Jockeys Championship by an insurmountable margin? Random misfortune aside, we know full well what would happen if he stayed on another year. He would be champion jockey a 21st time.To put this view into perspective, the gap between McCoy and Tom Scudamore, who is in second place in the jockey's table, is 82 wins, while the gap between Scudamore and third-placed Richard Johnson is two. Between Johnson and Sam Twiston-Davies it is four, between Twiston-Davies and Brian Hughes, 37. There is no margin anywhere comparable to the distance McCoy and the rest. There is no-one on his shoulder, no-one breathing down his neck, no-one gaining on him up the hill. What worries him \u2013 that people may think he is not the rider of old \u2013 is several years away, at least. Hence his fantasy of racing in disguise, without the burden of history. 'I'd ride forever if I could,' he explained.Ferguson got out of Manchester United at the right time. He could not have foreseen the calamitous fall of David Moyes' first season, but he must have had an inkling that his team might find it hard to retain their title. A businessman, too, Ferguson would have known the commercial cache in leaving a winner \u2013 the opportunities in the world of publishing, or at Harvard and beyond. Here was his chance \u2013 and who knows when the conditions would be right again? A man of many interests, and past retirement age, he stood down and prepared to enjoy life. It was absolutely the right thing to do.McCoy is unnerved by the thought of staying too long, of not going out a winnerYet McCoy's farewell is almost troubling. 'When he retired, they should have shot him,' said Jack Charlton of his brother, Bobby. 'I've never seen anybody so unhappy.' Sir Bobby has, thankfully, since made the second life all great sportsmen crave, as an ambassador for Manchester United and the Football Association, and a voice of reason within the boardroom at Old Trafford. McCoy, almost certainly, will find a berth in racing where his expertise will be valued, no doubt with JP McManus. Yet it still won't be Fakenham on a wet Thursday \u2013 it won't be the Weatherbys Novice Hurdle at Towcester, in which McCoy piloted his 4,000th winner, Mountain Tunes.For an athlete at the top as McCoy has been for so long, nothing can quite compare to the thrill of competition. For McCoy, any competition. The sheer number of times he took a race on sets him apart. In 2001-02, he rode over 1,000 times in Britain alone and since Richard Dunwoody claimed 160 winners to be crowned champion jump jockey in 1994-95, McCoy has surpassed that total in each of his 20 seasons. There will never be another like him \u2013 a fact he wanted to make sure of before retiring. It was important he would go to his grave unmatched.Brian Clough was relegated in his final season as manager at Nottingham ForestYet it is that determination, the desire for the victory no matter how small, that cannot be replicated in retirement. Gary Neville is very serious about his media work and won a broadcast award given by the Royal Television Society in March. His bosses at Sky wanted him to make a fuss about it. He refused. He wouldn't even recognise the news on his Twitter page. It was clear he didn't feel this achievement compared to those in his playing career. Then last week, when Salford City \u2013 the club he owns along with other members of the Class of 92 \u2013 won Northern Premier League Division One North, Neville was all over it. Whatever McCoy's place in the world from here, it cannot compare to the thrill of the chase.That is why punters loved him, why his farewell at Sandown has long been a sell-out. This is a jockey who \u2013 on at least two occasions \u2013 rode winners that had drifted to 999-1 on Betfair at the midway stage. He was unseated by Family Business at Southwell in 2002 but kept watching the race and, on seeing the other four competitors variously fall or retire, remounted and won. Two years later, on the aptly named Mini Sensation at Exeter, he almost lost touch with the field with a circuit to go, before hitting the front 50 yards out. Mini Sensation had recorded eight straight losses going into that race.Paul Gascoigne (left) travelled to pitifully obscure outposts in the twilight of his careerMcCoy's wife, Chanelle, will be pleased her husband no longer risks adding to a roll call of injuries that make the longevity of his time at the top all the more remarkable \u2013 and McCoy's father says he no longer enjoys watching him race. Maybe, deep down, even McCoy himself wondered how long he could continue to dodge the big one \u2013 the fall that might challenge his champion status.'One minute you're a world-class athlete, walking down the road, holding your head up, feeling bullet-proof,' said Billy Schwer, former IBO light-welterweight champion, now retired. 'You're Billy the Boxer. Then, in an instant, just Billy.'McCoy has been trying to prepare himself for that moment all week. He turned down rides at Perth to give him the feel of spare time before sundown at Sandown. He is not looking forward to the weekend after, when he feels it will truly hit home. 'A lot of people wanted me to go to Perth,' McCoy said, 'but if I went to Perth I could think 'why not do one more week at Punchestown?' A lot of days I wish I wasn't doing it, that I hadn't said it. But I'm not changing my mind. I'm too stubborn for that.'Legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson got out of Manchester United at the right timeHe leaves having transformed his sport, having helped create four-day festivals that capture the imagination like at no time in history. He leaves having dominated for 20 years \u2013 a feat unparalleled, setting records that will not be so much as glimpsed at a distance, let alone challenged in his lifetime. And he leaves sounding every bit as certain as Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre did in 2008, bringing the curtain down on a career of similar achievement.'I've given everything I can possibly give to this organisation,' Favre said. 'I don't think I have anything left to give. It's over. As hard as it is for me to say, it's over. I will wonder if I made the wrong decision. I'm sure on Sundays I will say I could be doing that or I should be doing that. But all good things must come to an end.'The world agreed, and wished him well. The next year, he was back.", "ref": " AP McCoy finished well ahead of rivals in Jump Jockeys Championship. There is no-one on his shoulder, no-one breathing down his neck .

Jack Grealish has become the third top flight starlet caught on camera inhaling nitrous oxideGrealish starred for Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool on Sunday at WembleyRaheem Sterling, 20, and Saido Berahino, 21, have been pictured doing the same recently and the PFA will look to increase their education to players on the risks of nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas.Users say it creates feelings of euphoria and light-headedness but drug advice website Frank warns 'there is a risk of death as a lack of oxygen can occur'.Sherwood said on Thursday: 'I'm not pleased. I spoke to Jack first thing this morning as he came in, I explained to him his behaviour can't be tolerated by the football club.'He did not come in here with the \"I'm only young, I'm allowed to get away with it\" attitude. He was very ashamed and does not like the bad publicity. He's assured me it won't happen again.'Grealish has not been fined over the incident and will be in Villa's squad for the trip to Manchester City. He was given his first Premier League start on April 7 and has been integral to his side's success in the past three games.The PFA have noticed a growing trend in the recreational use of nitrous oxide, and will look to adapt their extensive tutoring programmes on substance abuse. John Bramhall, PFA deputy chief executive, said: 'We're working with Sporting Chance, delivering the message, and it's a continuing process. It will change as different issues come into focus.'The selfie, which shows Grealish and a friend, was taken in a hotel room after a night out, according to The Sun. Sherwood hopes Grealish can learn a lesson, not only about his choices but how such information can come into public knowledge.'He's hurting but he needs to stop hurting,' said Sherwood.

I want him to forget about this by Saturday. I don't want him to dwell on it. It only really affects me if I let it affect him on the pitch.'As I said about Raheem last week, he's a young man. Jack was even younger a year earlier when the picture was taken. But it doesn't matter how young he is, he is now in a responsible position as a professional footballer, he's got to make sure it won't happen again; he's assured me it won't.'I'm not worried. To be honest there is only one form of discipline, that's self-discipline, that's what really matters. Jack has to take that on board now. This is an eye-opener for him, he has to realise he has to be very careful who he can trust out there.'I think he's a fantastic talent, he's willing to work hard at it, he will be a big player for the future of Aston Villa football club.'Grealish, who presented an award at his cousin's Under 12s team on Tuesday, has thrived on the pitch under the responsibility handed to him by Sherwood.'The circumstances probably dictated that I thought, \"Why not? Let's throw the dice. Let's get him in there\". He's not let anyone down.'", "ref": " Jack Grealish was pictured inhaling nitrous oxide through a balloon .

His death from a severe spinal chord injury sparked widespread outrage toward the Baltimore Police Department.Gray's death in custody is the latest in a string of high profile deaths involving African-Americans and law enforcement.Many have demanded answers about what happened to Gray and his funeral drew civil rights leaders, politicians, and relatives of others who died in police custody.Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland spoke at the funeral: \"To mother Gloria and to the entire family, I want you to know we stand with you during this difficult time.\"Cummings said he \"looked at the cameras\" and reflected on the great amount of attention Gray was receiving in death: \"Did anybody recognize Freddie Gray when he was alive?\" he asked.Cummings said that Gray joined the church in 2001. He was in youth choir and was a junior usher. \"He loved church,\" Cummings said.Gray also played football. \"Did you see him?\" the representative asked.\"There are those who will tell you don't cry. I'm not going to say that,\" Cummings said.Gray also had a history of run-ins with the law. According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24.He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to the Maryland Department of Corrections.Families United for Justice was also at the funeral. The group includes relatives of Eric Garner, who died last July after a New York City police officer put him in a chokehold. Protests erupted after a grand jury declined to indict that officer.Other members of the group include relatives of Amadou Diallo, who was fatally shot by New York police officers, and Alberta Spruill, who died of a heart attack after police threw a stun grenade into her apartment during a botched raid.The White House sent Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson, chair of the Obama administration's My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Heather Foster, an adviser in the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Elias Alcantara from the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.Exactly what happened to Gray remains a mystery. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died.News of Gray's smashed upper spine and the delay in getting him medical care has triggered outrage across the country.Hundreds of protesters peacefully rallied on the streets of Baltimore on Saturday against the alleged police role in Gray's death. A small group turned violent.About a dozen young men smashed police vehicles with garbage cans, climbed on top of the cars and stomped on them.Some hurled water bottles and other objects at police.Others funneled their anger toward local businesses, looting or damaging a 7-Eleven, a Michael Kors store and a Subway restaurant.Baltimore police arrested 35 people, including four juveniles. Six officers suffered minor injuries during the chaos, which ended a week of civil and peaceful protests.Gray's twin sister deplored the violence.\"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence,' \" Fredericka Gray said Saturday night. \"Freddie Gray would not want this.\"Baltimore City Paper said its photo editor, J.M. Giordano, was tackled and beaten by police while covering the protests.The paper said Giordano was standing near protesters when someone threw a rock at police. Officers responded, and Giordano was unable to get out of the way.\"They just swarmed over me,\" he said. \"I got hit. My head hit the ground. They were hitting me, then someone pulled me out.\"The incident was caught on video, which Baltimore City Paper posted online.And Reuters photographer Sait Serkan Gurbuz said Baltimore police detained him Saturday night.Officers called the detention of the two journalists inadvertent.\"One journalist (Gurbuz) was released with a criminal citation, which is being recalled,\" police said in a statement. \"One journalist (Giordano) was released without any charges.\"Cell phone video of Gray's arrest shows him screaming and being dragged, with some witnesses saying he looked like his leg was injured.Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said he was appalled that Gray did not receive proper care immediately. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care \"multiple times\" -- such as at the site of the arrest and at other times during his transport to the police station.Batts also said there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled into the transport van.But Baltimore's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 shot back: \"These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete,\" union President Gene Ryan said in a written statement.Five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, Batts said. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions.And while the preliminary work on Gray's autopsy has been completed, the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and might ask spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report could take 30 to 45 days.Not just Freddie Gray: Others who died in police custodyHolly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; Miguel Marquez reported from Baltimore.

In some cases, the government will not be able to provide an explanation because of national security concerns.The changes partially lift a veil of secrecy enshrouding a policy that has been a centerpiece of the government's counterterrorism efforts since the September 2001 terror attacks. Grounded or not grounded? Under legal pressure, the Obama administration will begin telling some suspected terrorists if and why they are on a list of tens of thousands of people banned from flying to, from or within the U.S. Above the security line at New York John F Kennedy International Airport in October But the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in an ongoing federal lawsuit, said the changes don't go far enough in giving travelers the legal due process they are entitled to, including seeing the evidence held against them and getting an opportunity to challenge it.The explanations provided to six travelers so far, which were mandated by a federal judge, have been inadequate, the ACLU said.For instance, in a letter to New Jersey resident Amir Meshal, the government's explanation for his inclusion on the list was based on information the FBI obtained from Meshal when he was detained in Africa in 2007, ACLU attorney Hina Shamsi said. The ACLU considers Meshal's detention to be unlawful and said he suffered abuse.'From the face of the letter, a neutral decision-maker would have no idea whatsoever that any of that occurred,' said Shamsi.The Justice Department declined to comment on the specific constitutionality challenges because of the ongoing lawsuit.Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas said, 'We are committed to a process that protects Americans from terrorist threats while respecting privacy and safeguarding civil liberties.'Last fall, there were about 64,000 people on the no-fly list, according to the government. Typically, less than 5 per cent of those on the list are Americans. The list fluctuates in size.Previously, the government's policy was never to confirm or deny that a person actually is on list, citing national security concerns. In most instances, travelers assume they are on the list because they are instructed to go through additional screening at airports or because they are told they can't board their flights.Travelers have been able to appeal their presumed placement on the list since 2007. Only a small percentage of appeals the government receives each year have been from travelers actually on the list, the government has said. The TSA gets between 15,000 and 20,000 requests a year, and less than 1 per cent of those are actually from people on the no-fly list, said Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron.In 2014, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, required that the government notify 13 plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list of their status on the list, and seven were told they were not on the list.The government provided explanations to the six plaintiffs it confirmed were on the no-fly list, including Meshal. One of the explanations included just a 'single cryptic sentence about alleged travel to a foreign country,' according a court document filed earlier this year. The letters to the six plaintiffs on the no-fly list have been redacted on the public court docket to protect the plaintiffs' reputations, Shamsi said.'The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again,' Shamsi said.The TSA will continue to handle the petitions under the new policy. The changes are not yet in effect, and have so far only been applied to the 13 plaintiffs in the Portland lawsuit, but the Homeland Security Department said it expects them be in place soon. Catron said individual requests should take months to process, not years.'These enhancements continue to ensure that individuals who are deemed to be a threat to our aviation security are prohibited from boarding a flight within, or bound for, the United States,' Catron said.", "ref": " Previously, the U.S. did not disclose whether a stopped traveler was on the list or why. But facing legal pressure from the ACLU, the Obama administration has enacted a new policy to let Americans know if they are on the list. Grounded Americans are also now allowed to inquire about how they got on the list. However, the government has not promised to reveal why in all cases - citing possible national security threats .

He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League.In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game.That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out.Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the sideFerdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being droppedFerdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikelyFerdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering careerHe would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission.Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether.Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out.He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment.By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them.Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a 'remarkable coup for the club.'Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a 'remarkable coup' for the clubBut after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the benchPremier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13FA Cup (1): 2003-04Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013Champions League (1): 2007-08FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight.He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay.Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear.Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season.His suspension for using the word 'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order.Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this seasonBut Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectationsChris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry RedknappQueens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on TuesdayAs you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon.And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road.Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations.That fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely.There are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen.For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat.The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League", "ref": " Rio Ferdinand missed 3-3 thriller with Aston Villa through injury.

Known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him. And this week he faced accusations from the model Kate Upton that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission. Scroll down for video In a new interview with Vogue Kate Upton has revealed that the photographer Terry Richardson released footage of her dancing in a bikini in a video called 'Cat Daddy' without her permissionIn an excerpt from an interview Kate did with Vogue in June 2014, it was claimed that Kate was not happy with Terry for releasing the 'Cat Daddy' footage which has been viewed more than 22 million times.In the one-minute-long film, which played a huge part in Kate's rise to fame, and which was uploaded to YouTube two years ago, Kate is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption.Alexa Chung writes in Vogue: 'Terry Richardson found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in May 2012, when he uploaded his now infamous video of Upton in a teeny-weeny bikini doing the Cat Daddy, a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding, \"paws\" aloft.'The video received millions of hits on YouTube - not to mention a number of slow-motion versions for the more discerning customer - but, at the time, Upton was horrified because the behind-the-scenes video had been filmed for fun, not something she expected would make the final cut.'Terry has worked with Miley Cyrus (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) shooting them in his New York studioTerry sat front row at the Alexander Wang fashion show in September 2013 alongside Kanye West When asked about the situation Kate said: 'I was like, \"That was disrespectful, you could have told me!''.'But Upton also adds that there's no bad blood over the YouTube video anymore. 'Now, obviously, it's fine.'However this is not the first time that the 49-year-old photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kim Kardashian in his New York studio has faced controversy. In fact, to say Richarson's reputation precedes him would be an understatement. He is the man who the Guardian once referred to as 'fashion's shameful secret'.Known to many as 'Uncle Terry,' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be Terry - fellatio whilst he is dressed as a horse.Further sexual shots show Richardson completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths. Terry is a regular on the red carpet at some of the biggest event sin the world, he is pictured here heading into the Vanity Fair Oscar's party Indeed it's been more than ten years since Terry first hit the headlines for his questionable behaviour.In 2004 an intern named 'Alex' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled 'slut', something which the Terry described at the time as, 'It's Sesame Street!'Then in 2009, a model called Sena Cech claimed that Terry's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob, apparently telling her: 'Sena, can you grab his c*** and twist it real hard? He likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it.'In 2010 a model named Rie Rasmussen confronted Terry at a party in Paris after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in America, models under the age of 18 are considered underage. She said: 'He takes girls who are young, manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of. 'They are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.'Terry poses with Pharrell Williams (left) and James Franco (right) doing his signature thumbs up poseTerry is good friends with Lady Gaga who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in New York in 2010Furthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against Richardson. One model named Jamie Peck revealed that when she was 19 she worked with the photographer on two separate occasions. Jamie said that the second time she had her period and Terry asked 'to take my tampon out for him to play with. \"I love tampons!\" he said, in that psychotically upbeat way that temporarily convinces so many girls that what's fun for Uncle Terry is fun for them.'She refers to the fact that Terry wanted to make 'Tampon tea,' with her used sanitary product.  Jamie revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by Terry but by his team after he took all of his clothes off. Terry once told the Observer of his shoots: 'A lot of it starts with me saying to a girl, \"Do you want to do nudes?\" And they're like, \"I don't want to be naked\".'So I say, \"I'll be naked and you take the pictures. You can have the camera. You can have the phallus\".'Despite the allegations which have been levied against him Terry remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with Ralph Lauren and Emmanuelle Alt Last year model Sara Ziff spoke to Huffington Post Live about working with Terry and said: 'You are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for Harper's Bazaar, whose one of his clients. 'That's a legitimate job, and he will ask you to take your clothes off for the casting and in some cases give him sexual favors. 'I have spoken with other models who have been in these situations, and he makes you feel like you're being a prude or you are somehow weird if you are not willing to just go with the flow because it's all cool. It's all fine.'She also revealed that there is a, 'ring of silence,' in the fashion industry as young women feel pressured to keep quite in order to further their careers.  Richardson rarely responds to the allegations levied against him, but in March 2014 - after a model posted a piece on Reddit including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for Page Six.Charlotte Waters claimed that during her shoot Terry became aggressive and it 'became sexual act after sexual act.'Terry poses with Hilton sisters Paris (left) and Nicky (right) at the opening of his Terrywood exhibition in 2012In the letter, posted by the US gossip website, Richardson said that the accusations were 'false,' 'hate filled libelous tales.' He said: 'Enabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the Internet, people have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors, because I have come to realize that absent my voice in the conversation, all that remain are the lies.' He said: 'I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. 'I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly, and as such, it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history.'The model Daisy Lowe has previously defended Terry saying: 'He just exudes this sexual energy, so he doesn't need to ask girls to take off their clothes. Honestly, they just do it.' Terry poses with troubled actress Lindsay Lohan Terry's lost numerous over the years and there are many people in the fashion industry who no longer work with him. These include shopping giants Target and H&M and brands such as Vogue, the New York Times and Equinox. The model Coco Rocha said in 2010: 'I've shot with [Terry Richardson], but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.' However Richardson remains popular within the celebrity circuit and is often seen partying with the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams.And he still works with the likes of Harper's Bazaar and brands such as Supreme and Yves Saint Laurent. Designer Marc Jacobs once defended Terry as being, 'not ill-spirited.' Terry's career as a photographer came after he failed to make it as a punk rock musician. He got his first big break in 1994 with a shoot for Vibe magazine. Since then he has enjoyed a stint living in London working for publications such as The Face and Arena but now shoots mainly from his studio in New York.The photographer has also directly music videos in his time. One of the most controversial was for Lady Gaga. Terry shot the video for Do What U Want a collaboration between Gaga and R Kelly last year, however, the project was later scrapped. TMZ later obtained a clip of the highly sexualised film which one anonymous source told the New York Post was, 'literally an ad for rape.'The clip shows Gaga lying on a hospital bed, she is put under anesthetic by R Kelly who then fondles her body along with a series of models.  MailOnline have contacted a representative for Terry for comment.", "ref": " Terry Richardson is accused of releasing film without model permission.

The plan, called the Mole Urban project, aims to reduce the level of road freight within urban areas by using freight pipelines carrying goods in capsules to edge of town consolidation centres, where they would be collected.Scroll down for video One of the Mole Solutions capsules inside one of their pipelines at their testing site in Northampton A graphic showing how the Mole Urban project would work by sending freight in underground pipes rather than on the road The firm is now looking to see if the concept could be used within the town of Northampton and if results are positive, a pilot could see underground pipelines installed to transport goods.The development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other towns, although it is still a long way from fruition.The proposal, would see the driverless capsules propelled by a magnetic wave produced by linear induction motors.A track has already been constructed in Northampton to test the capsules with data being collected on commercial and environmental influences. However, the firm say that even irrespective of the final results for the test case, the process established in the project can be used to assess other locations that have major congestion and pollution problems caused by excess road usage.The development project is set to last nine months and if successful could be rolled out in other townsDr Roger Miles, head of Mole Solutions told the Independent: 'Clean water is taken into homes and dirty water is taken away and we never really see it, while huge amounts of oil and diesel are transported by pipes and underground.'Now we want to do something similar with freight, delivering goods to buildings and taking away waste.'The concept has already had funding from the government and is also attracting support from private businesses too.The company is already one of several businesses that have attracted support from the Transport Systems Catapult, a government-funded centre set up to support innovation in transport.The Transport Systems Catapult is currently working with the UK Government and over 70 major multinationals on 'Intelligent Mobility' inventions with major market potential, including driverless cars, underground sensors and freight pipelines.

It is one of the biggest takeovers ever.News of the deal has driven up the price of shares in BG now owned by people who originally bought British Gas shares in 1986. British Gas was privatised by Margaret Thatcher's government after the widely publicised 'Tell Sid' campaign. The share sell-off, which encouraged people to spread news of the offer with the slogan 'If you see Sid, tell him', saw more than 1.5million people pay 135p a share when the company was listed on the Stock Exchange.In 1997 British Gas was split in two to form the oil explorer BG Group and the British Gas owner Centrica. Shareholders received shares in both companies.Those investors who retained these shares have since received hundreds of pounds in dividends. Anyone who bought 100 shares at the time of privatisation would have paid \u00a3135 (\u00a3366 today, after taken inflation into account). The holding across the now separate companies of Centrica, National Grid and BG Group, is currently worth more than \u00a31,604. The proposed Shell takeover will mean investors are now due 383p for every BG share they own. Investors will also be in line for higher dividends. But the windfall pales in comparison to the rewards for BG Group's newly arrived chief executive Helge Lund who could be in line for more than \u00a330million in pay and perks if the deal completes next year. Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, (left) shakes hands with the Chairman GB group Andrew Gould (right)  during a press conference to announce Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to buy British Gas, in LondonMr Lund was poached by BG to help turn around the group and started in February, just weeks before talks to sell the business began.The takeover, which will create a company valued at \u00a3200billion, could be the first of many in the oil sector as the falling oil price, means firms are vulnerable to predators.The bid has been months in the planning. Shell 'ran the numbers' on BG, Britain's third largest energy company, last year as its share price has fallen by a fifth since the oil price crash.His signing-on bonus was cut from \u00a312 million to \u00a310.8 million in December amid outrage from investorsShell's chief executive Ben van Beurden made a call to BG's chairman Andrew Gould on Sunday March 15 and a 'cloak and dagger' meeting took place at the Dorchester Hotel last month. He described the deal as a 'fantastic fit' and said the 'logic' to buy BG has always been there but that the falling oil price made it a 'whole lot more compelling'.The deal will have to be approved by a series of regulatory bodies worldwide including the European Commission.Shell employs more than 94,000 people across 70 countries. BG has 5,200 staff across 24 countries. News of the merger led to job fears. In the UK Shell has around 6,500 staff while BG employs around 1,600. Shell is in the process of laying off 500 people at its North Sea operations where old oil fields are becoming too expensive to operate.Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, (left) and Andrew Gould (right).

Researchers in Massachusetts say a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skillsFor the body to begin moving, the brain's primary motor cortex sends signals through several other brain regions, including the supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.These brain areas activate spinal neurons that stimulate muscles to execute the movement.But many factors can interfere with motor ability, including sleep deprivation, which reduces dexterity.In people with Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra are killed off, leading to tremors, slowness of movement, and difficulty walkingResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have now created an algorithm that can tell how effectively someone is striking a keypad.For instance, it can distinguish between typing done in the middle of the night, when sleep deprivation impairs motor skills, and typing performed when fully rested.It does this by analysing something known as 'key hold time' - a measure of how long a key is pressed before being released.The study is based on the premise that 'there might be hidden information in the way that we type,' says Ian Butterworth, one of researchers.'At the moment, pretty much all of the other information in typing is thrown out. We just pay attention to what keys are being pressed, not when or for how long.'Scientists have developed a six-minute test which could give an early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.Currently Parkinson's patients only discover they have the debilitating neurological problem when the symptoms have already taken hold.But last year Oxford University academics have come up with a new way of spotting the disease at an early stage.The researchers were able to detect early Parkinson's disease with a remarkable 85 per cent accuracy.The technique uses an MRI scanner to monitor the neural connections in a concentrated area at the very centre of the brain.Even at a very early stage, Parkinson's patients had much weaker connections in the basal ganglia region of the brain, which is associated with motor control.The study, which has been published in the journal Neurology, found that by taking 180 pictures in six minutes they could spot the poor connections.They also found that the test had a very low chance of incorrectly diagnosing healthy people with the disease.This study focused on the effects of fatigue, but the researchers say they could diagnose conditions that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's disease, much earlier than is now possible.Preliminary results from a study of about two dozen Parkinson's patients suggest that the researchers' algorithm for analysing keystrokes can also distinguish people who have the disease from those who don't.The team is now planning a larger study of Parkinson's patients.They are also working on smartphone apps that could be used to gather the same kind of data from mobile devices.'We thought this was a unique opportunity to have a window into the brain using your normal interactions with an electronic device,' says MIT researcher Alvaro Sanchez-Ferro.'You already have the hardware. You just have to let someone evaluate the information you collect every day when you use the device, and try to pull it out for health-related purposes.'People are usually diagnosed with Parkinson's disease five to 10 years after the beginning of the disease, and lot of the damage has already been done, the researchers say.John Growdon, director of the Memory and Movement Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, says it will be important for the researchers to demonstrate in future studies that the typing deficiencies correlate with the severity of Parkinson's disease.'Overall, it strikes me that this has great potential to detect subtle motor impairments even in advance of a clinician's ability to find them,' adds Growdon, who was not involved in the study.The researchers believe this strategy could also be used to evaluate patients with other diseases that affect motor skills, such as rheumatoid arthritis.'This might have applications in any disease producing a motor impairment, whether it's in your hands and muscles or the brain,' Sanchez-Ferro says.The team are working on smartphone apps that may be used to gather the same type of data from mobiles", "ref": " MIT's algorithm reveals how effectively someone is striking keys.

Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of a 1946 export permit (pictured) will bolster their claim that Constable's painting was legitimately brought to BritainConstable's masterpiece Beaching A Boat, Brighton was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World WarThe discovery of the permit in the archives of Budapest's Museum of Fine Arts is the latest twist in an increasingly fraught dispute between the Tate and the descendants of the painting's original owner, Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who died in 1958.The descendants of Hatvany \u2013 believed to be two daughters and a grandchild \u2013 say the Nazis stole the painting and smuggled it out of Hungary.It turned up in Britain in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the Tate in 1986.The family launched a claim three years ago. The Government-backed Spoliation Advisory Panel, which rules on disputes over looted art, supported the heirs last year and said the Tate had a 'moral obligation' to return the painting. Sources close to the case say the export permit could prove the Tate's claim that Hatvany voluntarily disposed of the painting while he was still alive.The Tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the Nazis but the gallery's understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported.Stormy seas: The battle over Constable's painting evokes the story of a Jewish refugee's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film Woman in Gold (pictured)Gallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in Hungary after the war. But The Mail on Sunday understands the claimants will argue the permit doesn't change anything as it does not identify Hatvany.One source said: 'If you had stolen the painting, you would still need to get an export permit to get it out of the country.'A source at the Tate explained that there was legal duty to protect any assets owned by the British public, which is why the gallery argued that the painting should remain in the UK. They said: 'No one disputes that the picture was at one stage looted by the Nazis, what is in dispute is what happened after it was returned to its owner.'The dispute evokes the story of Dame Helen Mirren's new film, Woman In Gold, which charts the story of how Jewish refugee Maria Altmann battled for almost a decade with the Austrian government to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic picture of her aunt called Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.", "ref": " 'Beaching A Boat, Brighton' taken from Jewish owner in Second World War.

Local media said a man had also been detained. Separately, police detained a gunman on Wednesday who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added.It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election. Today, the grieving family of Mr Kiraz who died after being shot in the head and chest during yesterday's courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul. Turkish police secure the area in front of the Istanbul police headquarters where an armed woman was shot deadPeople react to the shooting of an armed woman in Istanbul. She was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistolPlain-clothed police officers block a street leading to the police headquarters in Istanbul on Wednesday April 1Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shotTwo of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him.Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported.Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded.'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz.Justice Minister Kenan Ipek said the two members of the DHKP-C who took him hostage had 'held a gun to the nation'.'We don't see this as an attack on our deceased prosecutor, but on the whole justice system,' he said at a ceremony for Mr Kiraz.'Our state is powerful enough to track down those behind these lowlifes... The fact these assassins are dead shouldn't put those nefarious and dark forces at ease.' Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisationMourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15Respects: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in IstanbulGathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremonyDefiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyerMr Kiraz, a father of two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan.The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left.Police chief Selami Alt\u0131nok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuriesShattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shotThe emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz.Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut.Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency.  In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks.The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head.Standing guard: Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siegeHorror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin ElvanProtesters: Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostageEmergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building.

We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said.Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passedDemands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-leftThe DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan.He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police.Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death.The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013.

They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space (illustration of a satellite in orbit shown). It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphereThe study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, was picked up by Mark Zastrow from Eos.The accelerator being proposed would be three times stronger than anything like it before, producing a beam with particles 0.5 to 10 million electron volts.Pulses of the beam would last just 0.1 microseconds.The accelerator would be located in space, 185 miles (300km) above the ground, and would fire back towards Earth's atmosphere.There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights.Auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles (32 to 320km) above the planet's surface. The interactions between the charged particles give off light.Auroral displays appear in many colours: red, yellow, green, blue, and violet.The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting. The common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles (240km).It would be based on a instrument called the Compact Particle Accelerator for Space Science (Compass), which is being developed by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and SRI International, both in California.'The authors say that employing such instrumentation would offer many scientific opportunities to study the behaviour of particles in the upper atmosphere,' wrote Mr Zastrow.'The paths of the electrons would trace out the arcing field lines of Earth's magnetic field, illustrating how they bend and snap during the intense geomagnetic activity caused by solar storms.'As they descend into the Earth's atmosphere, some of the electrons would strike atmospheric molecules, producing visible aurora-like emission.'He added that the beam might even be able to trigger different forms of lightning, including red sprites and blue jets.For now the idea is only a concept, and there are no concrete plans to build it.But the team says that by proving it works, it could be a step towards actually making it.There are two types of auroras on Earth - the Aurora Borealis in the Northern Hemisphere, known as the Northern Lights, and the Aurora Australis in the Southern Hemisphere, known as the Southern Lights. Shown is the Aurora Borealis above the Snaefellsnes Peninsula in IcelandIt would not be the first experiment with Earth's atmosphere, though.In Alaska there is an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp).Haarp is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance.In Alaska there is already an ionospheric research programmed called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp), pictured. It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technologyThe station regularly uses a tool called the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. It is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the Ionosphere.Haarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.It has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims.", "ref": " Scientists in California described how to create artificial auroras on Earth.

Body part traders are known to exhume graves in order to obtain body parts in the cruel tradeA similar remark was made by Tanzania's Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda in 2009 when he urged citizens to kill anyone on the spot if they were found with the limbs or organs of albinos.Albino rights group have called for greater protection of albinos but said killing suspects was not going to deter criminals offered large sums of money for securing body parts as they were likely to still take the risk for the promised reward.Witchdoctors will pay as much as $75,000 for a full set of albino body parts, according to a Red Cross report.Vicky Ntetema, executive director of Under The Same Sun, a Canadian non-profit organization defending albino rights, said campaigners wanted justice for those people kidnapped, mutilated and murdered.'But we have to remember that all those goons caught red-handed ... are small fish - agents and executors of the big sharks out there,' she said.'Killing them on the spot is not going to help us catch the inducers, those with money to hire these gangs who continue to terrorize innocent people with albinism and their families.'An albino boy sits between his two parents at their home in MalawiNtetema urged police in Tanzania, Malawi and Burundi to quiz suspects to get information about the witchdoctors who use albino body parts and their clients.'We all need to unite and find the culprits who are hiding behind the killers ... Why would people kill albinos if they were not asked to get their organs by someone?' she said.The plight of people with albinism has worsened in East Africa in recent years, according to U.N. and police figures, with concerns that an election in Tanzania this year will prompt more attacks as politicians seek luck at the ballot box.The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Said Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein last month urged African governments to combat impunity for crimes against people with albinism.Albinism is a congenital disorder which affects about one in 20,000 people worldwide, according to medical authorities. It is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and affects about one Tanzanian in 1,400.Mainasi Issa, 23, is one of a number of Malawian albino women under police protection in the impoverished African countryMainasi Issa carries her two-year-old daughter along the path outside the hut in which she lives", "ref": " Albino men and women continue to be hunted for their body parts in Africa.

{"i": "e2d4a8c8e5b3ba50108d66b3e726da22bedb470b", "src": "Across the globe, more than 42 million children under the age of five are overweight or obese.And the rising tide of obesity extends into adulthood with 1.9 billion adults worldwide overweight, 600 million of which are classified as obese.But with experts desperately trying to find the answer, a poignant debate rages.Should fast food and sugary drink companies be allowed to advertise their junk food to children? Should TV ads promoting unhealthy food and drink be banned until the watershed, or wiped out altogether to save adults' waistlines too? A recent survey by the British Heart Foundation showed two fifths of parents are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on TV, prompting the charity to deliver a 30,000 strong petition asking the Government to ban junk food adverts being shown before the 9pm watershedA recent British Heart Foundation survey quizzed more than 2,000 parents with children under the age of 16.It showed two fifths of them are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on TV, and feel that TV junk food adverts make it difficult to help their children eat a healthy diet. If you are a parent like me, you are probably nodding knowingly about now.There is plenty of scientific evidence to back up our frustrations too \u2013 showing that food commercials aimed at children focus on products high in fat, salt and sugar, and that youngsters develop positive attitudes towards the foods they see advertised.Despite regulation, children in the UK are still being exposed to more TV advertising for unhealthy than healthy food items, even at peak children's viewing times. What's more, regulation doesn't prevent the advertising of unhealthy products during programmes in the 'family entertainment' bracket, which include some of the most popular television programmes watched by children such as X-Factor and Britain's Got Talent.Seven in ten parents said they would like stricter regulation on the food industry's use of advertising. Good on them. The BHF has therefore just delivered a 30,000 strong petition, asking Government to ban junk food adverts from being shown before the 9pm watershed, to help protect our children from making unhealthy choices.Do you think the big food and drink manufacturers are unduly worried about this? Not when they can use one of our national icons to act as a giant advertising hoarding instead.Dr Sally Norton criticised Coca-Cola's sponsorship of the London Eye, noting it gives the company the chance to advertise to almost four million visitors a yearAs someone at the forefront of managing obesity, I am furious that we are allowing blatant advertising to influence our children in other ways. Take Coca-Cola's sponsorship of the London Eye. With London Eye staff apparently wearing Coca-Cola branded uniforms to match the promotional material displayed around this family attraction, the company gets the chance to advertise to 3.75 million direct visitors a year. What's more, we will do plenty of advertising for them as we promote the 'Coca-Cola' London Eye, our top paid-for tourist attraction, around the world.As Coca-Cola knows all too well, linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the London Eye is likely to forever link Coca-Cola to the idea of 'fun' in the minds of young, impressionable kids (and adults).Dr Norton backs the British Heart Foundation's bid to ban TV junk food ads before 9pmMerlin Entertainments, who own the London Eye, said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets. True \u2013 but the stark truth is that we aren't making the best choices, with two thirds of us overweight, a quarter of us obese and the NHS spending \u00a36 billion pounds a year on obesity.That same 'failure of personal responsibility' meant the Government recognised that we needed extra help to tackle smoking \u2013 and widespread advertising bans and preventing smoking inside public buildings was implemented. In just the same way, we can't tackle obesity alone and need help \u2013 not giant Coca-Cola branded wheels reminding us of the sugar-laden temptations it promotes.Reducing TV advertising to children as the British Heart Foundation are suggesting, will, of course reduce the number of junk food advertisements children see. But, as the London Eye disgrace shows, junk food advertising isn't limited to TV.There are plenty of ways by which companies can market to kids or adults outside of TV advertising and the regulations for non-broadcast advertising are currently weak or non-existent.Our children seem to spend an increasing amount of time online, actively engaging in social media, and the junk food and drink manufacturers are busy providing games, social networking apps and other tools to promote their brands in cyberspace where the adults often fear to tread.A study by the Children's Food Campaign, of 100 websites featuring food likely to be bought or requested by children, found that more than 80 per cent of online adverts were associated with foods classed as less healthy and therefore not allowed to be advertised during children's TV programmes.Yet more than 75 per cent featured child-friendly characters, competitions, downloads and links to social media apps that directly engaged with kids.This is because the internet regulations don't prevent our kids being targeted and manipulated in this way.This 21st century method of targeting our teens is a sneaky way of tapping into a 'screen-obsessed' generation.She says: 'As Coca-Cola knows all too well, linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the London Eye is likely to forever link Coca-Cola to the idea of 'fun' in the minds of impressionable kids' Sponsorship, whether of tourist attractions or sporting events like the Olympics, is another great way of ensuring that products trigger positive connections \u2013 harnessing the feel-good factor, which can last well into the future. Interestingly, research has also shown that companies seen to be involved in 'charitable' activities or corporate social responsibility can lead consumers to infer that their products are healthier and even lower in calories, leading them to consume more.Their good deeds create a 'health halo' effect, just in the same way labelling and packaging can persuade consumers that they are buying a healthy, 'natural' products for themselves or their children.Sneaky junk food advertising is invading all aspects of life \u2013 how can we resist?So, it's a big 'yes please' to banning junk food advertising before 9pm. But don't think for a minute that this will deter manufacturers of the high sugar, high fat, processed food that provides little, if any, nutritional benefit for our kids. Plenty of other advertising opportunities are open and they are busy working on how to manipulate us and our kids into buying more and more of the heavily processed rubbish that is damaging our health.To read more visit www.vavista.com", "ref": " Worldwide, 42 million children under the age of 5 are overweight or obese.

Franklin is around 40 miles from Norfolk.The body has been sent to the Chief Medical Examiner's Office to be identified and to determine the cause of death. The FBI is now involved in the investigation, police said.Missing: AJ Hadsell has been missing since March 2 and on Thursday, police announced they had found remains 40 miles from her home. They have been sent to the medical examiner's office for identificationIt comes after police focused their search on a pond near Carrsville last week after receiving a tip that her cell phone may be below its surface. Her stepdad Wesley Hadsell was arrested for breaking into a home; he says he was looking for AJTwo days after the Hadsell vanished, police received a tip that she had been seen on the Virginia Commonwealth University campus, two hours away from where she was last seen by her family. Investigators have previously said there is no evidence of foul play, but her family and friends have said she wouldn't disappear on purpose.Earlier this week, her grandmother, Katherine Hadsell, blasted authorities for seemingly 'doing nothing' to bring the teenager home. And in a twist, Hadsell's stepfather was caught allegedly breaking into a home two weeks after Anjelica's disappearance, an act his mother Katherine says was out of fatherly concern.She told ABC News her son Wesley had heard his stepdaughter could be inside the home.'As any father would, if you hear that your daughter may or may not be in a house or being held or some of her belongings or at a location, any father is going to try and find out,' she said.He was arrested on March 21 after being interrogated by police for more than 15 hours. Hadsell, 36, had not been named a suspect and has insisted he does not know where AJ is. He faces charges of obstructing justice, possessing ammunition and breaking and entering.Search: Last week, authorities searched a nearby pond near Carrsville (pictured) after receiving a tip that her cellphone might be below the surface. Carrseville is just six miles from where the remains were foundFears: The 18-year-old freshman vanished while home on spring break from Longwood UniversityBut Hadsell, who had been working in nearby Franklin, around the time of the disappearance, said he was only thinking about his daughter.'I couldn't sit a minute away from where my daughter may have been,' he told WAVY.com.While searching the property for around 15 minutes, he claims that he discovered her jacket.'I was just trying to make the evidence come to light,' he said. 'It's not like I had the jacket, I didn't plant the jacket, I didn't know anything about that. It was the fact of the overwhelming information that led me there.'  The stepfather has aroused local suspicions because he has a lengthy felony criminal record.In 2005, his ex-wife went missing for several days and he was reportedly arrested after allegedly kidnapping her and driving her across multiple states.Concern: Her grandmother Katherine Hadsell said earlier this week that she did not think police were doing enough to find the teenager. She argued that her son, Wesley Hadsell, had been arrested unfairlyCharges of rape, kidnapping, assault and domestic violence were later dropped. He also served 54 months in prison for a bank robbery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, according to WTKR - but he insists that he is now a changed man.  And in another twist, Jennifer Busby, AJ's mother, said she received texts from her daughter's phone shortly after he disappearance but was not convinced she was actually messaging the girl.AJ is described as standing at 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 120 pounds.", "ref": " Anjelica 'AJ' Hadsell, 18, has been missing since March 2, when she was home in Norfolk while on spring break from Longwood University.

Pingan was then adopted by his uncle  Zhao Yanchao and his grandmother Xiao Kaixing.On Saturday, Pingan celebrated his first birthday publicly - about a month after his real birthday of March 18 - in his hometown Xiamen, surrounded by family members and the volunteers and doctors who treated him at the time.Uncle Yanchao said: 'I lost my older brother to an absolute tragedy, now I have a duty to see him live on in Pingan.Chinese media reported  that the baby boy had been 'catapulted' from his mother's womb (left) when the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. Pingan (right) celebrates his first birthday with his familyPimgan was dubbed China's 'miracle baby' by local media after his miraculous start in life (pictured) 'He already has his eyes and his mother's smile. I shall love and treasure him as I know they would have done.'To celebrate his birthday his aunt, Ms Zhang, in keeping with Pingan's native Sichuan tradition, gave some items for the little boy to 'hold on to' to determine his future. He immediately took a calculator, pen and an apple. 'These three items indicates Pingan will safely proceed with his studies and he will have a deep interest in learning.' said a smiling Ms Zhang.When Pingan was seven months old he was taken Beijing's Tiantan Hospital Neurosurgery department to have an operation to drain the build-up of water in his head.A doctor said because of Pingan's injuries his development may be a bit behind his peers, especially in his speech and ability to walk.Pingan enjoys a piece of cake as he celebrates his first birthday one year on from the horror crash But despite his difficult start in life Pingan has developed into a happy and smiling little boy. Now Pingan's uncle and aunty are preparing to move and work away from home in order to bring in more money as they are concerned about the ongoing treatment he will need.'Pingan may still need further operations,' said his uncle Zhao Yanchao.Baby Pingan suffered from minor bruises and scratches when he was found at the scene of the accident last year.Police spokesman Chan Chien said at the time: 'Eye witnesses said that when the woman was hit by the truck she gave birth on the spot. 'Pingan is a happy little boy - but his family are concerned he could require further hospital treatment for the injuries he received in the crash'Others said that the baby which was a healthy 4.2 kg had been thrown out of the woman's belly and had landed three meters away.' Police confirmed soon after the accident that they had arrested a 45-year-old truck driver who had apparently turned into the road just as the motorbike was coming along.A spokesman from Beiiing Tian Tan Hospital said shortly after the accident: 'The baby has had an MRI scan because he is suffering from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, which was caused by the accident.'He will need to undergo more surgery although we do not think his condition is serious.'He truly is a miracle baby.' Xiamen City Hospital Paediatrician Dr Fang Mei, who treated Pingan at the time, said on Saturday: 'When he first arrived he was covered in dirt with cuts to his head.' 'Weighing over 9lb the baby boy still had his umbilical cord and placenta attached to him when he arrived at the hospital.' Dr Fang said that as Pingan had hit the floor quite hard he had sustained some nerve damage to his fragile body.She said: 'None of the medical staff had seen how Pingan was pushed out of his mother's body and we wonder how it could have been possible - but the fact that he survived is something of a miracle.'Pingan's plight moved the nation and volunteers and charities flocked to offer their time and help with his recovery.Two branches of the Red Cross in Xiamen City set up a '3.18 Hai Cang Miracle Baby Fund' and were able to find 50 'Loving Mummies' to provide him with round the clock care and attention.The head of a local charity volunteer group, Ms Li, said they set up a call to action movement to help the miracle baby and were 'overwhelmed' by the response. Nappies, toys, as well as expertise and time were all donated to Pingan.

The activist group claim imprisoned women are tortured using a device known as 'the biter', a iron bar with sharp jagged edges. Placed on the helpless woman's chest, the serrated edges of the bar are pressed into the woman's skin, causing deep lacerations.Such is the violence of the torture, some women reportedly slip into unconsciousness due to the pain. Aqsa Mahmoud, a 20-year-old woman from Glasgow who fled to Syria in 2013, is reportedly the leader of an al Khansaa group known as 'Om Amara'.Om Amara is reportedly a female foreign battalion, with just two Arabic speakers who mercilessly patrol the streets of Raqqa.Begum made contact with Mahmood, known as Umm Layth, on social media prior to departing for Turkey.Begum also used her Twitter account to follow two other members of the al-Khansa brigade known only by their Islamic names Umm Khattab and Umm Waqqas.In one of her recent tweets, Umm Waqqas advised British women on marriage in the Islamic State saying they should choose their jihadi fighters carefully and not to marry any 'Tom Dick or Harry'. The British women jihadists in Syria have conducted a sustained recruitment campaign in the last few months and are thought to operate a woman-only jihadi route for European girls who are groomed to leave their Western lives for the caliphate. They use social media, including Tumblr, Twitter and Ask.fm to publish detailed, practical advice about how to adapt to life in Islamic State and suggest essential items that the teenage wannabe-jihadists will find useful when they arrive. Privately-educated Glaswegian Mahmood - along with Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22 - are thought to be helping patrol Raqqa with guns and daggers hidden beneath their robes.Terror leader: Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), who was reported missing by her Scottish parents in 2013, is now a prominent member of a dangerous all-woman police force that dishes out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa, SyriaShocking: In 2014, Aqsa Mahmood posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a Syrian man executed for criminal acts in Syria as young children looked onTrained to kill: One of the Halane twins, who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, tweeted this picture with the caption: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State with humble sisters'Wrong hands: The three teenagers who recently fled to Syria are feared to be with the al-Khansa Brigade, who have been accused of oppressively monitoring the behaviour of women in the cityThe group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in the city and dishing out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material.Mahmood recently advised that the Syrian winter was even colder than what she had experienced in her native Scotland and suggested 'winter woolies' were an essential.Seventeen-year-old British jihadi twins Salma and Zahra Halane from Manchester, who left for Syria in June last year, are thought to be with older British women who have taken on matriarchal roles within the group.They have been posting pictures on their Twitter accounts showing four al-Khansa women - veiled and armed with automatic weapons - undertaking 'self defence' training.Umm Khattab started a Twitter account on June 27 - the day after Zahra and Salma Halane went missing from their home in Manchester to head for Syria. Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to join the Al-Khansa Brigade in Syria in June last year - after becoming radicalised onlineShooting practice: One of the twins tweeted an image showing the women of Al-Khansa practising with their automatic weapons while dressed head-to-toe in black niqabsBrain washed: The Halane twins have posted a number of pictures on their accounts where they are dressed completely in black and brandishing deadly weapons - just like their Al-Khansa sistersPath of extremism: Yusra Hussein (pictured), 16, was also reported to have arrived in Syria in October and is also thought to have been mentored by British jihadistsShe later tweeted: 'Missing twins \u2013 chilling with one of them now', adding she had met 'many British girls' since arriving in Syria.The female branch of ISIS also released an eye-opening manifesto stating Western women who join the terror group have a duty to wed a jihadi \u2013 then spend their life cooking, cleaning and raising a family.Two other British schoolgirls, Yusra Hussien, 16, from Bristol and Samya Dirie, 17, from south London, who were reported to have arrived in Syria last October, are also thought to have been mentored by the British jihadists. Brutal patrols: The duties of the all-woman jihadi group  include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguiseJihadi bride: Another Briton who left Britain to join ISIS is Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare (left, with her Swedish terrorist husband Abu Bakr)Muslim society: Members of the all-female Al-Khansa Brigade are seen walking in their adopted capital of Raqqa in SyriaSecurity services say that 600 British Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and around 60 of them are young women.According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, a US-based monitoring group, al-Khansa was set up by ISIS commanders in Raqqa, northern Syria, in February last year.Its members dress in black robes, wear a full face veil and are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 Syrian pounds - about \u00a3100.Their duties include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguise.

Another player who has come into their reckoning though is Udinese's Allan Marques Loureiro. The 24-year-old Brazilian is a box to box midfielder and also has a Portuguese passport.Song, on loan at West Ham, also has interest from AC Milan.

The 25-year-old has been offered \u00a32.5million a year tax free by Turkish side Galatasaray yet is keen on a move to the Premier League or Italy where Roma have the strongest interest.Stoke are unlikely to be his destination but they are showing ambition in their moves this window and want to inject pace with their latest signings. They have held talks about a \u00a34m deal for Evian's Daniel Wass, 25, and asked about Yannick Bolasie of Crystal Palace.

He also impressed at the World Cup in Brazil. Besic has picked up 11 yellow cards and can tread a fine line disciplinary-wise at times but Everton are keen to keep him.Roberto Martinez is a confirmed fan but the fact Besic has not started regularly has prompted clubs to check whether there is potential to strike a deal.Everton are looking for another midfielder, two forwards and a left-sided centre-back. They have also checked on Aberdeen's promising midfielder Ryan Jack, 23.Interest from Arsenal and Tottenham also remains in James McCarthy but his price tag or Everton's reluctance to listen to offers will make that difficult.22-year-old Everton midfielder Mohamed Besic has been attracting interest from European clubsReal Madrid may need to pay Iker Casillas \u00a310million to leave. The future of the 33-year-old goalkeeper is under scrutiny every day and his form has not been what is should be. That has prompted more calls for Madrid to bring in David de Gea from Manchester United but first Casillas would need to move on. He is contracted until 2017 and earns around \u00a35.75m a year. In terms of recognition for his service, his advisers would push for the club to pay him his outstanding salary on the contract.Real Madrid could end up paying veteran goalkeeper Iker Casillas \u00a310million to leave the clubDavid de Gea is tempted by a return to Madrid but has still to decisively make up his mind on when that should be.Although Arsenal have been linked with Casillas, there are reservations about his form, something that has also been questioned within the Madrid dressing room. MLS sides and those in the Middle East have shown an interest in Casillas should he opt to go.Key for Madrid, and United, is that any impending transfer ban will either accelerate decisions to buy or put blocks on sales.David de Gea is tempted with a move to Madrid, but could yet stay loyal to Manchester UnitedCrystal Palace and West Brom have shown an interest in Montpellier defender Daniel Congre.Congre, 30, can play at right-back, centre-back and left-back.

{"i": "7ffb99fd125f6a1b3e7893dbce4ea63e6d6b8f67", "src": "A previously unknown seasonal change on the sun is occurring every two years, according to a new study.Researchers have found that twisted bands of magnetic fuel reach the surface of the sun every two years - in addition to its existing 11-year cycle.And when the seasons combine, the activity of the sun can be amplified, producing mega storms that are even more dangerous to Earth than others.Scientists in Colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle. Every two years it appears 'bands' of magnetic field move to the surface. This combines with the existing 11-year solar cycle, causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections (CMEs), pictured, and solar flares that can endanger EarthThe study was carried out by a team of researchers led by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado.They found that the changes seem to be driven by bands of strong magnetic fields in the sun's hemispheres which emanate from the solar interior.It was already known that the sun goes through a solar cycle of 11 years, during which its activity increases and decreases.Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth's magnetic field.Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents.But this shorter two-year season seems to also play a part in the sun's activity, on a similar scale to the 11-year cycle - despite being much quicker.The new solar season occurs when twisted, ring-shaped 'bands' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a 'transition' region in the outer third of the sun.'Much like Earth's jet stream, whose warps and waves have had severe impact on our regional weather patterns in the past couple of winters, the bands on the sun have very slow-moving waves that can expand and warp it too,' said co-author Dr Robert Leamon, a scientist at Montana State University.'Sometimes this results in magnetic fields leaking from one band to the other.'In other cases, the warp drags magnetic fields from deep in the solar interior, near the tachocline, and pushes them toward the surface.' The result of this motion is that the bands create turbulent regions of activity on the surface, causing solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).CMEs are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun, and they can pose a threat to satellites in Earth orbit.Solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun, which are sometimes associated with CMEs - although their connection is not well understood.The new solar season discovery occurs when twisted, ring-shaped 'bands' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a 'transition' region in the outer third of the sun. Shown in this illustration are the various different regions of the sun and a sunspot (top right)The bands, which appear in each hemisphere of the sun, cause the 11-year solar cycle to actually become a longer cycle that lasts 22 years.The 11-year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun's activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots, flares and other visible differences.A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released.Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to X-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end.The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same timeA flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots.Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods. However, the cause of the 11-year cycle is poorly understood.And according to this new research, when the 11-year cycle combines with the two-year cycle, the solar storms that pummel Earth's atmosphere can be amplified.The bands  appear to take place separately in the northern and southern hemispheres, with activity peaking over 11 months, then dropping over another 11 months.The almost annual variations can be likened to regions on Earth that have two seasons, such as a rainy season and a dry season.'What we're looking at here is a massive driver of solar storms,' said Dr Scott McIntosh, lead author of the new study and director of NCAR's High Altitude Observatory.'By better understanding how these activity bands form in the sun and cause seasonal instabilities, there's the potential to greatly improve forecasts of space weather events.' The overlapping bands are fueled by the rotation of the sun's deep interior, according to observations by the research team. The study, published this week in Nature Communications, could help lead to better predictions of massive geomagnetic storms in Earth's outer atmosphere that sometimes disrupt satellite operations, communications, power grids and other technologies.The research was funded by Nasa and the National Science Foundation, which is NCAR's sponsor.The 11-year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun's activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots, flares and other visible differences. Shown here are images of the sun over one cycle showing changes in its activityThe surges of magnetic fuel from the Sun's interior catastrophically destabilise the corona, the sun's outermost atmosphere. They are the driving force behind the most destructive solar storms.'These surges or \"whomps\" as we have dubbed them, are responsible for over 95 per cent of the large flares and CMEs - the ones that are really devastating,' Dr McIntosh said.The almost-annual variability can also help explain a cold-war era puzzle: why do powerful solar flares and CMEs often peak a year or more after the maximum number of sunspots?This lag is known as the Gnevyshev Gap, after the Soviet scientist who first reported it in the 1940s.The answer appears to be that seasonal changes may cause an upswing in solar disturbances long after the peak in the solar cycle.Researchers can turn to advanced computer simulations and more detailed observations to learn more about the profound influence of the bands on solar activity.Dr McIntosh said this could be assisted by a proposed network of satellites observing the sun, much as the global networks of satellites around Earth have helped advance terrestrial weather models since the 1960s.'If you understand what the patterns of solar activity are telling you, you'll know whether we're in the stormy phase or the quiet phase in each hemisphere,' Dr McIntosh said.'If we can combine these pieces of information, forecast skill goes through the roof.'", "ref": " Scientists in Colorado have found evidence for a new solar season cycle.

When the two combine it can create amplified and dangerous storms.", "scores": {"sup4_6b": {"overall": 4.0, "accuracy": 4.0, "coverage": 5.0, "coherence": 7.0, "bert_score_p": 0.34396892786026, "bert_score_r": 0.2681478261947632, "bert_score_f": 0.3069104552268982, "mover_score": 0.12122758399239986, "rouge1_r": 0.27083, "rouge1_p": 0.37143, "rouge1_f": 0.31325, "rouge2_r": 0.06383, "rouge2_p": 0.08824, "rouge2_f": 0.07408, "rougel_r": 0.14583, "rougel_p": 0.2, "rougel_f": 0.16867, "bart_score_src_hypo": -2.5275144577026367, "bart_score_hypo_ref": -8.809921264648438, "bart_score_ref_hypo": -3.692352771759033, "bart_score_avg_f": -6.251137018203735, "bart_score_harm_f": -2.601873635610279, "bart_score_cnn_src_hypo": -2.1201558113098145, "bart_score_cnn_hypo_ref": -3.471810817718506, "bart_score_cnn_ref_hypo": -2.5118913650512695, "bart_score_cnn_avg_f": -2.9918510913848877, "bart_score_cnn_harm_f": -1.45742741663021, "BLEU_1": 0.11061946902654866, "BLEU_2": 0.00044444444444444436, "BLEU_3": 0.00044642857142857147, "BLEU_4": 0.00044843049327354244, "METEOR": 0.10000000000000002}, "supcnndm1_6b": {"overall": 7.0, "accuracy": 7.0, "coverage": 7.0, "coherence": 7.0, "bert_score_p": 0.2155134528875351, "bert_score_r": 0.4289816915988922, "bert_score_f": 0.32119020819664, "mover_score": 0.14681801470513067, "rouge1_r": 0.52083, "rouge1_p": 0.33333, "rouge1_f": 0.4065, "rouge2_r": 0.21277, "rouge2_p": 0.13514, "rouge2_f": 0.16529, "rougel_r": 0.27083, "rougel_p": 0.17333, "rougel_f": 0.21138, "bart_score_src_hypo": -1.7101221084594727, "bart_score_hypo_ref": -4.051749229431152, "bart_score_ref_hypo": -6.6758575439453125, "bart_score_avg_f": -5.363803386688232, "bart_score_harm_f": -2.521429171565267, "bart_score_cnn_src_hypo": -1.169845700263977, "bart_score_cnn_hypo_ref": -3.0009381771087646, "bart_score_cnn_ref_hypo": -2.453521966934204, "bart_score_cnn_avg_f": -2.7272300720214844, "bart_score_cnn_harm_f": -1.349880197949401, "BLEU_1": 0.11061946902654866, "BLEU_2": 0.00044444444444444436, "BLEU_3": 0.00044642857142857147, "BLEU_4": 0.00044843049327354244, "METEOR": 0.10000000000000002}, "sup4_6b_ppo_rm4_6b": {"overall": 6.0, "accuracy": 7.0, "coverage": 5.0, "coherence": 7.0, "bert_score_p": 0.47305652499198914, "bert_score_r": 0.38480401039123535, "bert_score_f": 0.4294936954975128, "mover_score": 0.3030125321473034, "rouge1_r": 0.39583, "rouge1_p": 0.46341, "rouge1_f": 0.42696, "rouge2_r": 0.17021, "rouge2_p": 0.2, "rouge2_f": 0.18391, "rougel_r": 0.29167, "rougel_p": 0.34146, "rougel_f": 0.31461, "bart_score_src_hypo": -1.571533203125, "bart_score_hypo_ref": -6.497528553009033, "bart_score_ref_hypo": -4.220823764801025, "bart_score_avg_f": -5.359176158905029, "bart_score_harm_f": -2.55868832408535, "bart_score_cnn_src_hypo": -1.1969093084335327, "bart_score_cnn_hypo_ref": -3.362618923187256, "bart_score_cnn_ref_hypo": -2.3076558113098145, "bart_score_cnn_avg_f": -2.835137367248535, "bart_score_cnn_harm_f": -1.3684993166387873, "BLEU_1": 0.11061946902654866, "BLEU_2": 0.00044444444444444436, "BLEU_3": 0.00044642857142857147, "BLEU_4": 0.00044843049327354244, "METEOR": 0.10000000000000002}}, "tgt": {"sup4_6b": " The sun's 11-year cycle of activity is being replaced by a shorter two-year cycle, which is more intense.

Coastguards searched thoroughly but were unable to find her'Molly's usually very good, she doesn't chase animals.'She fell about 200ft but the cliff was on a slight slope. I couldn't see her at the bottom but my daughter did so we knew she survived the drop.'The coastguard winched one of them over the cliff and he went from side to side looking for her but couldn't see her.'It's rocky there, there's thick patches of gorse and it's extremely dangerous.'After a couple of hours they said they just couldn't spot her. They were very upset about it.'She added the incident left her 'completely numb'. 'We didn't stop searching at the end of the day,' she said. 'When I got home I phoned as many people as I could think of.'But fortunately, a female dog walker recognised Molly from the lost posters that had been put up in the area on Friday.After Ms Tipper put up missing dog posters, Molly was identified by a dog walker three days after going missing. Pictured right, the cliff face in Dorset where Molly fellMs Tipper added: 'The lady was walking her dogs when Molly followed her and sat next to her. She called me and we met up and fortunately it was Molly, I was worried it was going to be someone else's dog.'Molly was very pleased to see me, especially when I got a gravy bone out of my pocket.'She wasn't hurt or limping or anything, but she was shattered and spent the rest of the day asleep when we got home.'I think it's really knocked the stuffing out of her.

While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed.In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her.

When he heard her fiddling with blades he decided to take her to the hospital.The Native American woman, who was addicted to alcohol and meth, and drank half a bottle of vodka before she was taken to the hospital on the day she diedIn the summer of 2012, Jeanetta married Shane and two years later the couple gave up their newborn baby for adoptionShane said he told Jeanetta at the time: 'This isn't a joke. It's not a game.'While parked outside of the emergency room, Jeanetta took out the knife and Shane ran inside and told a staff member behind the desk to call the police.Following the exchange with police, Jeanetta was shot and killed.Valenzuela told detectives he thought she was 'absolutely gonna thrust at me' when he pulled the trigger, while Ziegler said the knife looked 'huge in her hands', according to the Guardian.In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor.Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d'Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified.His owner received an $80,000 payout two weeks ago as well as an apology from the mayor.Shane and Riley's three daughters so far have not even received an apology.The officers involved in the incident were cleared of any wrongdoing by a local prosecutor in November.

He was 71.Corliss died a week after suffering a major stroke, according to a tribute on Time's website by colleague Richard Zoglin, who called him \"perhaps the magazine's most quoted writer of all time.\"Unlike some critics, Corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of Ingmar Bergman to the epic fantasy of \"The Lord of the Rings.\" His all-TIME top 100 movies list, which he compiled with fellow Time critic Richard Schickel, contained everything from \"Pulp Fiction\" to \"Finding Nemo\" to Jackie Chan's \"Drunken Master II.\"\"He savored it all: the good, the bad, the indifferent. Except that he was indifferent to nothing,\" Zoglin wrote. \"To any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was 'worth seeing,' Corliss had a stock, succinct reply: 'Everything is worth seeing.' \"But Corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated, including \"Titanic\" (\"dead in the water\") and even -- blasphemy! -- \"Star Wars,\" about which he wrote, \"The movie's 'legs' will prove as vulnerable as C-3PO's.\"He also didn't care much for sentimental, uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win Oscars.\"There are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that I know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners,\" he once wrote. \"I call this internal mechanism my Built-In Hit Detector.\"A graceful and prolific writer, Corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies, penned many Time cover stories and authored four books on film, including \"Mom in the Movies: The Iconic Screen Mothers You Love (and a Few You Love to Hate),\" published just last year. (It was a partnership with Turner Classic Movies, which, like CNN, is owned by Turner Broadcasting.)Some credit him with coining the phrase \"drop-dead gorgeous\" to describe actress Michelle Pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film, \"Into the Night.\"He also cleverly, and subtly, gave away the big plot spoiler of \"The Crying Game\" by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review.Born in Philadelphia, Corliss moved to New York after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining Time in 1980. He served as editor of Film Comment, the movie journal of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, for 20 years, was a frequent guest on Charlie Rose's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in Cannes, Toronto and Venice.\"It's painful to try to find words, since Richard was such a master of them,\" Time editor Nancy Gibbs wrote in a note Friday to her staffers.\"They were his tools, his toys, to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write, like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep. It's not clear that Richard ever slept, for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life.\"He is survived by his wife, Mary, a noted film critic in her own right, whom he married in 1969.People we've lost in 2015", "ref": " Veteran Time magazine film critic Richard Corliss died Thursday night in New York City.

It shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky. The goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years. Red here shows more dark matter, and blue shows less. The moon is shown top left for scaleA team from the University of Manchester, led by Dr Sarah Bridle, has spent the past two years measuring the shapes of galaxies used to construct the map.And the map was released today at the April meeting of the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Maryland.It was created using data captured by the Dark Energy Camera, a 570-megapixel imaging device that is the primary instrument for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) led by Fermilab in the US.The survey uses the 13ft (four metres) Victor M. Blanco Telescope located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile.When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery.If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing.From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force.Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. And the project is run overall as part of the five-year Dark Energy Survey (DES), and is the largest map of this detail.Of course, we can't actually directly observe dark matter yet - so the survey instead looks for its noticeable effect on galaxies.Studying this enables the predicted amounts of dark matter in a given area to be mapped, based on its gravitational effects. 'Dark matter could equally be called \"transparent matter\", because we see things behind it that gets distorted by gravity,' Dr Bridle told MailOnline.In the map she explained we're seeing about 150 times the area of the full moon, which is about 0.4 per cent of the whole sky.The goal of the DES is to map 12.5 per cent of the entire sky, creating a 3D map of dark matter - and dark energy.'It is amazing to see a map of the dark matter over such a large region of the sky, and the full Dark Energy Survey mass map will be more than 30 times bigger still,' Dr Bridle said in a separate statement.'Analysis of the clumpiness of the dark matter in the maps will also allow us to probe the nature of the mysterious dark energy, believed to be causing the expansion of the universe to speed up.' This mosaic image shows the different telescope shots that were combined to make the dark matter map. The survey has just completed its second year. As scientists expand their search they'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matterThe survey has just completed its second year. As scientists expand their search, they'll be able to better test current cosmological theories by comparing the amounts of dark and visible matter.Those theories suggest that, since there is much more dark matter in the universe than visible matter, galaxies will form where there are large concentrations of dark matter (and hence stronger gravity) present.So far, the DES analysis backs this up. The maps show large filaments of matter along which visible galaxies and galaxy clusters lie and cosmic voids where very few galaxies reside.Follow-up studies of some of the enormous filaments and voids, and the enormous volume of data, collected throughout the survey will reveal more about this interplay of mass and light.These maps show how the amount of dark matter corresponds to the formation rate of galaxies. On the left, galaxies can be seen near dark matter clumps (in red), and further away from sparse regions (blue). The image on the right shows some of the regions of sky that were studiedThe team at Manchester analysed 130 million separate telescope images of galaxies to make the map.The process of measuring the galaxies is so complex and time consuming that some of the world's largest supercomputers are needed to do it.Each time a new catalogue is made it takes about as much computing power as running 500 ordinary desktop computers for two weeks.'We have to measure the shape of each galaxy - how distorted it is - with extremely high precision, about one part in 1000,' said Dr Joe Zuntz, also of the University of Manchester, who has been making the measurements.The survey uses the 13ft (four metres) Victor M. Blanco Telescope (middle) located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, outfitted with a newly designed, state-of-the-art Dark Energy Camera (DECam). It will be completed by 2018, mapping dark matter of an eighth of the sky in the processDark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up 85 per cent of all matter in the universe, is invisible to even the most sensitive astronomical instruments because it does not emit or block light.But its effects can be seen using a technique called gravitational lensing - studying the distortion that occurs when the gravitational pull of dark matter bends light around distant galaxies.Understanding how the clumpiness of dark matter changes with time will reveal the nature of the enigmatic dark energy, which is the ultimate goal of the survey.The dark matter map released makes use of early DES observations and covers only about three percent of the area of sky DES will document over its five-year mission.", "ref": " University of Manchester researchers reveal HD dark matter map.

An X-ray shows the earring lodged in her right bronchus - the airway leading to the lungsDoctors put a thin tube with a camera on the end known as an endoscope into the woman's lung, which showed the earring was covered in mucus (pictured)She took a deep inspiration, but immediately felt a painful scratch in her throat.She began coughing up blood, wheezing and became short of breath, and was rushed by ambulance to the A&E department of St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, the report said.When she arrived, doctors ordered a chest X-ray, and saw something was wrong straight away.There was a mass that had 'features consistent with a stud earring', and a CT scan confirmed the earring was stuck in the woman's right bronchus, one of the two main airways leading to the lungs.Doctors prescribed antibiotics to prevent any infection and then put a long, thin tube with a camera on the end into her throat - in a procedure known as an endoscopy.They were then able to examine the earring and remove it.They found large amounts of mucus around the earring, which was 'the body's attempt to expel the foreign body' Dr Lucinda Blake, one of the doctors who treated the woman, told LiveScience.Alison Hall, 48, almost choked to death when she swallowed a false nail that shot out of her inhaler when she took a puffIf they had waited to remove the earring, the woman's body might have healed over the earring, embedding it within the bronchus, Dr Blake added.The woman made a full recovery, but in the report, doctors said her case highlights the need for people with asthma to be told about the dangers of storing their inhaler without a cap.Writing in the report, doctors concluded: 'The importance of replacing caps on inhalers when not in use is illustrated and should be encouraged when inhaler technique is taught or reviewed.'The news comes after MailOnline reported on the case of Alison Hall, 48, who almost choked to death when she nearly swallowed a false nail that had shot out of her inhaler when she took a breath.Ms Hall, 48, was at work when she felt her chest tightening and took out her blue salbutamol inhaler.She took a sharp breath and felt something shoot to the back of her throat where it became lodged.The mother-of-one ran outside in a panic when a neighbour came to her rescue and began pounding her back before calling 999.After five minutes of choking, a false nail finally came loose from the back of her throat and fell out onto the pavement.She believes the nail may have worked its way inside the inhaler through a gap at the top, and is now urging others to check their inhalers before use", "ref": " Australian woman felt a wheeze and took a breath on her uncapped inhaler.

Daily Mail Online was on the flight.'Mrs. Clinton, when are you going to start talking to the press about Benghazi?' Daily Mail Online asked her in the Washington Reagan National Airport terminal. 'Did you make mistakes?' The usually garrulous and broad-smiling Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service and local police escorts, and said nothing.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEONO COMMENT: Hillary stared ahead and walked wordlessly Tuesday, refusing to acknowledge her first campaign-trail question about the deadly Benghazi terror attacks in 2012DEADLY: The September 11, 2012 Benghazi terror attacks killed four Americans including the US ambassador to LibyaWRONG: Both President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Clinton incorrectly blamed the Benghazi attacks on protests sparked by a YouTube video mocking Islam's prophet Muhammad. The two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four Americans who were killed at the sceneMoments earlier, she answered a question about why her taxpayer-funded security detail had sped at 80 MPH past exits for the smaller Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and trekked all the way to Boston for a flight with first class seats.'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't,' Clinton said.The Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah's military-style Benghazi attacks will likely be a thorn in Clinton's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season. The group laid waste to a State Department facility while she was America's top diplomat.A special congressional committee chaired by South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, has a mandate to investigate the episode through January 2017, making it unlikely that Clinton will be able to put the issue behind her.TROUBLE AHEAD: New Hampshire resident Brian Blackden included 'Benghazi blood' Tuesday on a sign listing reasons 'Hillary is a liar,' near the site of a Clinton appearance at the New Hampshire Technical InstituteOn Sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with Dartmouth College students in Hanover, New Hampshire, 22 of them made references to Bengahzi when asked about Clinton's chances of becoming president.Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened.'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online.He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office.'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.'NOT FORGOTTEN: U.S. Ambassader the Libya Chris Stevens was the first to die in Benghazi, and was seen by Libyans as a moderate \u2013 angering anti-American hardliners from radical Islamist groupsCASUALTIES: US Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith (left), US Navy SEAL Glen Doherty (center) and US Nacy SEAL Tyrone Woods (right) perished in the Ansar al-Shariah attacks in BenghaziFour Americans lost their lives in the September 11, 2012 terror attacks, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, the first American ambassador killed while on duty since 1979.U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith also perished in the initial barrage of mortars and automatic weapons fire. Hours later, a second wave of attacks hit a CIA annex compound nearby, killing CIA contract soldiers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both U.S. Navy SEALs.The four men came home in flag-draped caskets.Congressional Republicans want answers about Clinton's involvement in what they see as a potential cover-up of facts surrounding how the attacks unfolded and why \u2013 and how the Obama administration explained it afterward, just weeks before an election.Part of the swirling controversy involves a home-brew email server that Clinton exclusively used for her official electronic communications while she was secretary of state.Clinton never used an official 'state-dot-gov' email address, but told reporters on March 10 that she had given the State Department copes of 'official' emails \u2013 and acknowledged deciding herself which ones qualified.She deleted the rest, some 32,000 messages in all.Clinton's attorney has refused to hand over the server to congressional investigators. Gowdy, the Benghazi committee chairman, wants a neutral third-party to examine it and determine if Benghazi-related emails can be recovered.His committee said Wednesday that its report on the Benghazi attacks won't likely be finished until 2016, putting its release squarely in the middle of the presidential campaign's most hotly contested months.But the committee said in a statement that 'Secretary Clinton's decision to seek the presidency of the United States does not and will not impact the work of the committee.'Clinton's State Department infamously declined to provide her Benghazi outpost with the beefed-up security presence its station chief requested in the weeks preceding the deadly Ansar al-Shariah attacks.She claimed later that she never saw the requests, insisting that such routine diplomatic cables would never have made it to her desk, even if they were addressed to her.FIRST CLASS: Hillary (seated at the front, right) traveled in luxury from Boston to Washington, seated next to chief of staff Huma Abedin, after am 80 MPH Secret Service dash to Logan International AirportFAREWELL: Hillary Clinton waved at the end of her final campaign stop in New Hampshire on Tuesday, before hitting the road to Boston for the same Washington-bound flight that Daily Mail Online flew onIn the days following the attacks, Clinton said publicly that it was the result of a spontaneous protest over a YouTube video made by an American \u2013 a film that insulted the Islamic prophet Muhammad.Such protests were seen in other Muslim countries, but U.S. intelligence determined in real-time that the Benghazi attacks were well-organized and easily traced back to an Islamist terror network.Months later, following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about Benghazi, she testified in a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.Just days earlier, lawmakers disclosed that a top U.S. diplomat told them 'everyone' at the American diplomatic outpost in Benghazi knew 'from the beginning' that they were in the middle of a terrorist attack.'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton told the senators. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans?''What difference at this point does it make?'", "ref": " Former secretary of state landed Tuesday night at Washington Reagan National Airport after a first-class flight from Boston. Clinton stared ahead wordlessly, walked and didn't acknowledge questions as Daily Mail Online asked whether she had made mistakes in Benghazi. Deadly attacks, carried out by an affiliate of al Qaeda, claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other US personnel.

{"i": "aac1951c5c635d5c80ce2ca2f58e91e5348f4dee", "src": "John Hughes has revealed how he came within a heartbeat of stepping down from his job at Inverness as the Josh Meekings controversy went into overdrive this week.The Caley Thistle boss says he felt so repulsed by the gut-wrenching predicament being endured by his young defender - before he was dramatically cleared - that he was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves, just weeks before an historic Scottish Cup Final date.Keen cyclist Hughes set off on a lonely bike ride after hearing Meekings had been cited for the handball missed by officials in the semi-final against Celtic, and admits his head was in a spin over an affair that has dominated the back-page headlines since last Sunday.Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissedOnly messages of support awaiting him on his return from footballing friends brought him back from the brink of quitting.Hughes, who lives in the Black Isle just north of Inverness, said: 'I came in here this morning after a day off. I turned my phone off and was away myself, away out on the bike with plenty of thinking time: a great freedom of mind.'I was that sick of what has been going on in Scottish football I was seriously contemplating my own future. I'm serious when I say that.'I had just had it up to here and was ready to just give it up. If it wasn't for what happened when I turned my phone back on, with the phone calls and texts I received from people I really value in football, that my spirits picked up again.'The calls and texts came in from all over the place, from some of the highest levels across the game. I've had phone calls that have really got me back on my feet.'I wouldn't like to name them all, but there were a lot of good people and a good few close friends in the football fraternity. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time 'They were saying: \"You need to lead from the front, you need to fight it.\" That restored and galvanised that focus and drive in me. And, if that was how I was feeling, how was the boy Josh Meekings feeling? It should never have come to this.'Meekings was cleared to play in the final by the Judicial Panel yesterday, but Hughes insists this 'unprecedented' SFA wrangle must be the catalyst for change in Scottish football's governance.Although those who sit on the panel are drawn from many walks of life, ranging from former players and coaches to ex-refs and members of the legal profession, Hughes said he wants 'real football people' drafted in instead of the 'suits' he claims lack understanding of the nuances and spirit of the professional game.And he seemed to point a thinly-veiled finger of accusation at SFA chief executive Stewart Regan by alleging that compliance officer Tony McGlennan was a mere 'patsy' in the process.Overwhelmed by a huge upswell of support for Meekings, he said: 'No disrespect to those sitting on [the judicial panel], but you need football guys and that's where it's flawed. That's why I promised myself I'd never go back down there until that gets sorted out.'The last time I appeared was when I was down at Livingston. It was quite galling. You have to be qualified in what you're judging on. There's no one better qualified than ex-players and ex-coaches. For some reason the SFA don't want to go down that line. Why?'I couldn't tell you who I sat in front of while at Livingston, but they weren' t football people. I'm talking about playing the game, managing the game, coaching the game.John Hughes was ready to walk away from his post and the games he loves'There are hundreds of these guys I'm quite sure would go in there and do it, for the sake of football. We need to use this to make sure the whole process work better. Josh's case was unprecedented. How was that? Somebody needs to explain that to me.'I know the verdict has gone in our favour but I don't think this is finished. We need to sit down and look at the Judicial Panel process.'I don't believe in the Panel. I promised myself a couple of years ago I wouldn' t walk back into Hampden until it changes. I would never question their integrity but I want football people sitting in judgment.'They are making a football decision and I want football people. Look at what is at stake. Here we were talking about a young player's chance of playing in a Scottish Cup final. I'd be more confident with football people because they know the game.'The compliance officer is damned if he does, damned if doesn't. Is he getting used as a patsy in all this? I honestly don't know.'How far do you take it? We're opening a whole can of worms here. We had a strong claim for a penalty when the goalkeeper comes through the back of Edward Ofere. Where do you draw the line?'It's unheard of, but I honestly think there's a little bit more to it. We can use this whole episode to make it better.'Hughes, who accepted Meekings would have warranted a red card had the ref spotted the offence, refused to point a finger of blame at former club Celtic for the letter of complaint they wrote to the SFA in the aftermath.'Celtic keep getting flung into it, but I came in here this morning and all Kristine, our receptionist, says to me is that the phone had never stopped ringing with Celtic supporters wishing Josh all the best and hoping he plays in the final.'I believe that comes right from the top at Celtic. They conduct themselves in a great manner. I had the privilege to play for that club and everything they do is class.'What I will say is, in Scotland, we put people up on a pedestal. We love it. It's our character. And we love knocking them down again.'But see when there has been an injustice, one thing we do in Scotland is show a real solidarity to make sure we get it right.'That's what I'm finding about the whole of Scottish football in the reaction to this. There's a real coming together as they all recognise this is not right.'I have to be the voice of Inverness. I'm not really saying [all] that I really want to say. I'm trying to be calculated and honest. I think there's more to say. There's more to it.'", "ref": " Inverness defender Josh Meekings has won appeal against one-match ban.

Slade added the extras from out wide on the right and the Chiefs were under way.Exeter increased their advantage midway through the half when wing Matt Jess, who was on course to score from a loose ball, was pulled back twice off the ball by full-back Alex Tait. Referee Marius Mitrea had no hesitation in awarding a penalty try - which Slade converted - and Tait went to the sin-bin.Newcastle kept the Chiefs at bay while they were a man down and when they were back to full strength the visitors were awarded a penalty 12 metres out in front of the posts, which fly-half Catterick slotted over to get his side off the mark.Slade and Catterick then swapped penalties to leave Exeter with an 11-point lead at the interval.Dan Temm of Newcastle Falcons tackles Thomas Waldrom during the quarter-final encounter That soon became 18 points as just 45 seconds after the restart Ewers broke from inside his own half, shrugged off a couple of half tackles, before offloading to number eight Waldrom to stretch for the line.Slade converted and, 12 minutes later, added his second penalty from 30 metres out to make it 27-6.The Chiefs' fourth try came just before the hour-mark when Will Chudley chipped over the head of the defence and into the arms of McGuigan to go over, with Slade again adding the conversion.The Falcons may have looked down and out but Harris rounded a couple of forwards to score a breakaway try under the posts with Catterick converting to cut the deficit to 34-13.However, the Chiefs replied immediately through Hill to help restore their advantage and then Hill turned provider for Mumm to score the Chiefs' sixth and final try, with replacement fly-half Gareth Steenson converting both to cap a one-sided triumph.", "ref": " Exeter and Gloucester will go head-to-head for place in inaugural final .

{"i": "0bc55c4e3c651628ad0e409a8b7c15139a917e3e", "src": "In the first few days after the Sewol disappeared beneath the Yellow Sea, divers pulled body after body from the watery wreckage, bringing the dead home.And throughout the following days, weeks and months, Park Eun-mi waited to see if one of them was her 16-year-old daughter, Huh Da-yun.The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor.The Sewol sank on April 16, killing 304 people, mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to Jeju island, off South Korea's southern coast.\"We kept waiting with belief in finding our daughter. I thought once, 'Somebody will be the last person and what if it's Da-yun?'\" Park said.A year later, Park's life remains at a standstill. Nine have yet to be found.\"We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014,\" said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment. \"I cannot think about anything except to find my daughter and other missing people.\"Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank. Dozens associated with the ferry disaster have been sent to jail on criminal charges. But families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the Sewol are far from resolved.On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn.Passengers were told repeatedly by the crew members to stay where they were as rescuers would arrive soon. Many of them listened to the instructions and remained in place. As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out.Anger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel.Divers had to pluck the bodies from the water one-by-one, bringing the youngsters back to land in black body bags where they were met with the gut-wrenching cries of their families.On Thursday, the one year anniversary of the disaster, South Korea's President Park Geun-hye called for the salvage of the Sewol's wreck \"as soon as possible.\"\"Recently, there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage Sewol ferry. I believe that it is now time to earnestly prepare to salvage,\" she said.A government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing. The Sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction, according to the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.The agency anticipates a complicated technical operation to remove the ferry, which would weigh about 10,200 tons above water. The process could take over a year and a half, and that it would cost the South Korean government anywhere from $91 million to $182 million.The victims' families have demanded that the ship be recovered in order to thoroughly investigate the accident.Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response. Communication over the rescue efforts were jumbled, paving way for rumors and hoaxes. Criticism swirled over the South Korean Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out the rescue operation.The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports.The recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the Sewol died in May, and in July, five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed.Park, the South Korean president, pledged major reforms, dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong. That promised investigation has been hampered by politics and disagreements between the families and the government over who should participate in the investigation.Earlier this month, several dozens of family members marched to Seoul from Ansan, the suburb where most of the students had resided. Some of the families shaved their heads to demand political action.Several laws have been passed to inspect cargo weight and increase oversight in the industry.In the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity. Its cargo wasn't secured properly, which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance. An inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster.The sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken.\"The tragedy of Sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption, irregularity and going blind eyes,\" Park said on Thursday. \"Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously.\"In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates.Sewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, who was widely derided for jumping to safety, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury, and violating sea laws.In July, the body of a billionaire Yoo Byung Eun, who was believed to have connections to the company that owned the ferry, was found decomposing in a plum field.But some families say that wider, systematic problems that allowed the disaster to occur haven't been addressed.  Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.CNN's KJ Kwon and journalist Jungeun Kim contributed to this report in Seoul.", "ref": " Sewol ferry sank a year ago off the coast of South Korea, killing 304 people.

I especially liked the Beach Cabana at Mount Cinnamon, where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night.People come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach, at which local musicians play. This is the Caribbean at its best. Just beware of those generous drinks measures.The restaurant Yolo (which is text speakfor 'you only live once') specialises in sushi and Asian cuisine.I order plums, mangoes, cherries and avocados, all picked that day. The fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare, its signature dish, almost leaps off the plate.Come dine with me: Grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipesThe next day, I watch a fish cookery demonstration at Mount Cinnamon: a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut, ginger, lime, spices, peppers and chives, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire, and served with delicious breadfruit chips.If you want to mingle with Grenadans, there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market. St George's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island.In a 17th-century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit, exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory.Here, I learn to cook the Grenadan national dish, oil down. This is a hearty, one-pot meal with salted meat, chicken, breadfruit, callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings. The whole lot is stewed in coconut milk. Delicious!The food odyssey continues in the evening when I visit BB's Crabback Caribbean restaurant, overlooking the harbour.My favourite place to eat on the beach is La Sagesse, on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath-temperature sea.A place to cool your heels: Rosemary stayed at Grenada's elegant Mount Cinnamon resortNo tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the River Antione Rum Distillery - the last one in the Caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar, as they did in the 18th century.Rum is not to my taste, but it's interesting to see the process behind it.Belmont in the Grand Etang area is more to my liking. It's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm. We taste goat's cheese and salt fish fritters, a popular local dish.Even the governor grows her own vegetables.Her Excellency Dame Cecile la Grenade is the first woman governor on the island.

But recently there has been disagreement about regular screening for women in their 40s.Study authors Mei-Sing Ong, a research fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, and Kenneth Mandl, a professor at Harvard Medical School, say their findings indicate that the cost of breast cancer overtreatment appears to be much higher than previously estimated. Their $4bn figure is the midpoint of a range that depends upon assumptions about the rates of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnosis.Apart from the financial cost of screening tests and treatment, false positives and overdiagnosis expose women to risks from additional medical procedures, not to mention psychological distress. It is not uncommon for mammograms to turn up some apparent abnormality that has to be resolved with more imaging tests or a biopsy.'We're hoping that the financial cost of this problem will help cast into greater relief the human cost,' said  Mandl. 'The two messages together are powerful. The fact that this is not only a problem, but a very costly problem we hope will accelerate the attempts to try to fix the screening practices.'But another expert defended those practices, and called the study one-sided.'There was no attempt to balance the costs with the benefits,' said Richard Wender, who heads prevention, detection and patient-support efforts at the American Cancer Society. 'I strongly feel that every study that looks at the downsides of any screening test has to be balanced with the benefits.'The American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group - the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force - recommends that regular screening begins at 50.The study found that women aged 40 and 49 were more likely to have a false-positive mammogram, compared to women in their 50s.Early detection: Annual mammograms starting at 40 years old have long been considered standard for preventive care, because cancer is easier to treat if detected earlyThe American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at 40, while a government advisory group says regular screening should begin at 50Wender questioned the assumptions behind the new study, saying that the authors made a 'very selective choice of estimates' for the rates of false positives and overdiagnosis.'There is no debate about the benefits of mammography,' he said.Mandl responded that the assumptions in his study are supported by other research, and that by definition there is no medical benefit to mammograms that produce false-positive results.The study was based on billing data from a major U.S. insurer, including more than 700,000 women aged between 40 and 59 in all 50 states, from 2011 through 2013.The U.S. spends much more on healthcare than any other country, but lags behind other economically advanced societies on life expectancy and certain other health indicators. That has prompted strong interest among insurers, employers and government officials in comparing the effectiveness of competing treatments, tests and medications.Cancer treatment may end up being one of the most closely followed issues in the broader debate over healthcare costs and benefits. A different study also published in Monday's Health Affairs found that cancer death rates were lower in countries that spent more on cancer care, and that countries that increased spending the most made more progress in reducing death rates.", "ref": " Study estimates yearly figure for women aged 40-59.

Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical registerA jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008.He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop.He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.'The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong.His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010.A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed.The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust'The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011.He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour.One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.'Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.'His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012.He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing.Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep.'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant.A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.'The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial.'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.'  When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'", "ref": " Christopher Bridger, 25, attacked three women after drinking sessions.

She had significant financial responsibility but defrauded the school and thereby the community.'Ms Knight told the court that cowboy builder Lee Slocombe had carried out \u00a380,000 worth of work at Harkin's home in Pontypridd over an 18-month period from November 2012.Labelled a fraudster and a conman who swindled thousands from victims, Slocombe was jailed for 43 months earlier this year for fraud.In total, Harkin signed six cheques to Slocombe over a six-month period.In August 2013, she gave him a cheque for \u00a36,720, which she claimed in the school books was for a gazebo at Llwyncelyn School, but the cheque bounced as there was no second signatory.She signed another one in September of the same year for \u00a35,000, which was cashed at Cash Converters, in Aberdare, by one of Slocombe's employees.Since there was no second signatory on that one either, staff phoned the school and spoke to Harkin.'She said the cheque was genuine and that it could be drawn,' said Ms Knight.'She tried to fob school staff off when they asked her about it saying it was nothing to do with the school.' In total, Harkin (left) signed six cheques to cowboy builder Lee Slocombe (right) totalling \u00a330,000. She 'dabbled' in school funds while headteacher of the primary, a position she had held for nine yearsMs Knight said the bank refused to honour the cheque leaving Cash Converters out of pocket, forcing them to pursue a civil claim.Local authority auditors spoke to Harkin in the autumn and she claimed the cheque was a holding cheque for work to be done in October half-term.The auditor concluded it was an isolated incident and put it down to her naivety and inexperience.'It was the first trigger in the local authority to indicate something was amiss,' said Ms Knight.In November 2013, Harkin moved to Coedpenmaen Primary School in Pontypridd and in December wrote a cheque for \u00a35,000 for a shelter at Llwyncelyn.The bank refused to honour it but Slocombe took it to Abermarle Bond pawnbrokers in Cardiff, which cashed \u00a32,500 on the basis he would return to get the rest. He never did.Harkin issued another \u00a35,000 cheque later that month, which Slocombe partially cashed.She then issued a further three cheques on the same day on January 3 last year, one for \u00a35,000, which was rejected by the bank and another, which was not presented.The last cheque, for \u00a33,200, Harkin actually took into a Porth bank herself to cash after forging the signature of the deputy head, Susan Jones.'The defendant was seen making that transaction on CCTV,' said Ms Knight.'The cheques were signed during the school holidays because she knew there would be no likelihood of being caught by staff.'Slocombe carried out \u00a380,000 worth of work at Harkin's home in Pontypridd (pictured), which she shares with her bank manager husband Anthony and their two children, over an 18-month period from November 2012Slocombe  was jailed earlier this year for 43 months for fraud for swindling money from dozens of victims. Pictured: Rubble and building materials remain outside Harkin's family property in Pontypridd, WalesHarkin was called into a special meeting on January 21 last year and challenged about the irregularities.That led to a criminal investigation and Harkin admitted five counts of fraud and one each of theft and forgery.She told officers that she knew she should not have 'dabbled' in school funds.Marion Lewis, defending, said: 'It is a tragedy to see a woman of her calibre before the criminal court in such serious offences as these.She knows the effect her actions have had on the school and deeply regrets them.'The effects of her wrongdoing have been devastating. A successful career that she dearly loved has been destroyed. She is thoroughly ashamed.'She came under Lee Slocombe's spell. He charmed her. Her eyes were not opened until she was confronted with the fact that he had pleaded guilty to offences of fraud.'She has found it very difficult to come to terms with her own gullibility and feels completely humiliated.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard that not only did Harkin use the chequebook of Llwyncelyn Primary School (pictured) when she was headteacher there, but she also continued to use it when she moved schoolsMs Lewis asked for any sentence to be suspended but Judge Richard Twomlow refused her plea and jailed Harkin for 12 months.He told her: 'Not only were you responsible for writing the cheques but you were helping to try to get them cashed from the school account.'You forged a cheque. Someone else was being dragged in as well as the school to this fraudulent project.'There were no sufficient funds in the account and there was a risk that the cheques would be cashed making the school account go overdrawn.'Lee Slocombe may be a fraudster and a plausible man but he was doing work at your house. You must have known that the last thing you were entitled to do was to use school funds to try to help him.'This was a repeated and persistent breach of a high degree of trust. The school account never had much in it but that did not stop you from trying to access them with varying degrees of success through your own selfish needs because of your feelings for a man who told you he needed money.'These were deliberate and calculated frauds. You were not duped.'Speaking after the case, her husband Anthony said: 'I want to stress that every penny of the money spent on our house came from my pocket and not from the school's funds.'I am a bank manager and have proved to police that each pound and penny was met by us.'What Slocombe did with the money from the school is a mystery. He is very plausible and a convicted fraudster.He said his wife had given Slocombe the money to build a shelter at the school.'We feel very let down by Slocombe over the two-and-a-bit years he worked with us,\" he added.'He has conned many, many people out of thousands of pounds. We trusted him as did many other people and were bitterly let down.'", "ref": " Sian Harkin used school chequebook to pay for \u00a330,000 work on her home .

Alpha Delta President Ryan Maguire said members are disappointed and exploring options.Booted out: A Dartmouth College judicial committee has 'derecognized' Alpha Delta after several pledges received brands on their backsidesRegardless of the outcome of an appeal, Inge-Lise Ameer, interim dean, has the authority to withdraw recognition of Alpha Delta. She's taken evidence from the committee under advisement.Attorney George Ostler said last month Alpha Delta acknowledged a small group of members voluntarily chose to get brands on their backsides, but said the practice - which he compared to a form of self-expression akin to piercing and tattoos - was never a condition of membership and has since stopped.A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a whistleblower.By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid 'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'.When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker first reported last month.Toga! The 46-year-old Greek organization partly inspired the 1978 National Lampoon's Animal House starring John Belushi (pictured center) He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected.Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension.This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding.Making changes: Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced this year a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's futureA 1992 Rolling Stone article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'.Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time.The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity.The Greek organization has received bad publicity over the past four years.In 2011, two students were hurt when they plummeted from the roof of the Alpha Delta house, reported Valley News. Two years later, the notorious frat was indicted for serving alcohol to minors.

A magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper undergroundThe Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. Silicic is used to describe magma or igneous rock rich in silica.It is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago. The Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. It is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago.Although lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, the researchers said.Experts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site. Previous research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). To discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes.The researchers said the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock.The remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption. It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km).

To discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and his colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes.These readings combined data from the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, which collected shallow readings from nearby quakes in Utah, Idaho, the Teton Range and Yellowstone, and from the Earthscope array, which revealed deeper readings from temblors from more further afield.Each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano. The movement and structure of these waves could then be used to map the earth beneath. The researchers said in their paper: 'The Yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust', published in the journal Science, that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock. The remaining two per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption, they added.It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km).To put this into perspective, the Grand Canyon in Arizona has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles (4,168 cubic km) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it two-and-a-half times, and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times. Previous research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). The latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km) (illustrated)To discover the large chamber (shown in yellow), the University of Utah tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes. Each of these quakes created waves that 'echoed' around the supervolcano. The smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcano's caldera Researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago. If Yellowstone did erupt, estimates from a National Geographic report said its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly.A 10-foot (3 metre) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles (1,610km), leaving two-thirds of the US uninhabitable.This spread of volcanic ash, rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe. Not only do the findings reveal what is causing the high levels of carbon dioxide, researchers can use it to learn more about how the supervolcano connects to the hot-spot plume in Earth's mantle. It could also provide clues about the structure of other supervolcanoes. 'An understanding of its properties is key to enhancing our knowledge of volcanic mechanisms and corresponding risk,' said the researchers. 'This lower-crustal magma body has a volume 4.5 times larger than the upper-crustal magma reservoir [and] these estimates are critical to understanding the evolution of basaltic-rhyolitic volcanism and explaining the magnitude of CO2 discharge.'The presence of magma reservoirs underlying upper crust magma chambers has been inferred at other locations, but not detected.

It wasn't real to me what was happening.'Miss Jacobs pictured as a 15-year-old - the age she believed she was when she woke up one morning when struck by amnesia in her early 30sMiss Jacobs had Transient Global Amnesia, a form of memory loss brought on by stress. It affects five in 100,000 people in Britain, rising to 23 in 100,000 in the over 50s. Before her attack, Miss Jacobs, of Manchester, was worrying about a homeopathy business she ran. She was studying for a psychology degree and had her final exams approaching, and had recently split up with the father of her child.The condition caused the 'episodic' part of her memory to shut down, meaning she had lost all her emotional memories.But her semantic memory was still intact, meaning she could remember things she had repeated over time such as how to drive and phone numbers she had regularly dialled.Miss Jacobs has previously described lying awake at night and crying as she desperately tried to make sense of her life and longed to be back at school.She is now set to detail how she began to understand who she was in a new book, titled Forgotten Girl.The book reveals how she went about piecing her life back together using her personal diaries and those close to her.There is no specific treatment for Transient Global Amnesia other than support and reassurance from family and loved ones.Fortunately, Miss Jacobs had this support, and after eight weeks her memory began to return to normal.Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a type of amnesia involving the sudden, temporary disturbance in an otherwise healthy person's memory.The leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like phenomenon.TGA attacks are associated with some form of precipitating event in at least one-third of cases.In females, this event is more often of a strong emotional character; in males, it is more often related to some physical exertion.The most commonly cited precipitating events include sexual intercourse, swimming in cold water or enduring other temperature changes, and emotionally traumatic or stressful events.TGA is most common in people between age 56 and 75, with the average age of a person experiencing TGA being approximately 62.", "ref": " Naomi Jacobs woke up one morning believing she was 15 years old.

{"i": "8364862d47d4584ed222e7222ab8ba4f598dd3d6", "src": "Online blogging sensation Zoella has come under fire from Jamie Oliver's company over adverts for unhealthy foods that appear next to her vlogs on YouTube.Internet star Zoella, real name Zoe Elizabeth Sugg, has enjoyed meteoric success after her blog and video posts amassed a huge teen following on social media.Jamie Oliver's company, an enduring advocate for promoting healthy eating, has warned that young stars such as Zoella, 25, and fellow vlogger and boyfriend Alfie Deyes, 21, should be more aware of the adverts that appear alongside their posts.Wise words: Jamie Oliver's company has said that influential vloggers such as Zoella (right) should try and ensure adverts for unhealthy foods don't appear next to their postsIt comes after an investigation found that video blogs - known as vlogs \u2013 popular with children aged 11 to 17 are being hijacked by 30-second adverts for junk food and online gambling sites. Although some of these are for harmless products such as Dolmio pasta sauce or hair dye, others are for Haribo, Coca-Cola and for an online gambling website, according to the Independent newspaper. Oliver's own company says it has a deal with YouTube that ensures that the chef's channel on the video sharing website actively stops sugary food and drinks from being promoted next to his videos. On Sunday, Brighton-based Zoella posted a video entitled 'Stuff Your Mouth' with ThatcherJoe (My Brother). The video showed the star and her sibling trying to guess what each other was saying while filling their mouth with marshmallows. The post has already attracted over 1.5million views.The video blogger describes herself on her Twitter profile as 'YouTuber, Blogger, Friend & Pizza Addict'. Last year, she published her book Girl Online, which recorded record sales for a first-time author. On the back of her social media success, Zoella has also created her own beauty line. Her boyfriend has achieved similar success with more than three million subscribers signing up to his YouTube channel. The couple share a \u00a31million Brighton home. Although the Advertising Standard Authority (ASA) currently prevents food that is high in fat, salt or sugar from being advertised on television shows that appeal to children under 16, there are no guidelines about video bloggers, despite their growing influence. Matt Wilson, spokesman for the ASA told FEMAIL that while 'television-like content' posted on YouTube was not yet subject to the same guidelines, the ASA was 'keeping an eye on the situation'.He said: 'A recently commissioned Independent Review into the impact of online advertising of food and soft drink products on children showed that the available evidence on advertising's impact on children's dietary choices is limited, and does not merit a change to the existing rules.''Where the TV and online rules differ is on scheduling. As the available evidence shows, media differ; with TV having the most persuasive, albeit a moderate, impact on children's food preferences. 'This is why there are currently scheduling restrictions on TV (for foods that are classed as 'high in fat salt or sugar') that don't apply online and to other non-broadcast media.' Star couple: The young web-savvy entrepreneurs can count a beauty line and several books between them but should they be more conscious of what they're promoting to their young audience Zoella's boyfriend, Alfie Deyes, a hugely successful blogger in his own right featured Jamie Oliver on a vlogging post last year. Ads for McDonalds and Coca Cola ran alongside the footageA virtual career has brought bricks and mortar: Zoella splashed out \u00a31million for her first house last year. The luxury property is in the seaside town of BrightonThe vloggers are unlikely to have control over which adverts appear next to their posts although Oliver's company is suggesting that such influential stars should be proactive in requesting that certain brands, such as Haribo and Coca Cola, do not appear.When Jamie Oliver appeared alongside Alfie Deyes, who is dating Zoella, ads for McDonald's and Coca-Cola appeared. A representative from the chef's company told the ipaper that while they couldn't control what appeared on others' channels, they did have a 'firm agreement' with YouTube about what could appear on Oliver's own Food Tube channel. FEMAIL has contacted Zoella for a comment. Professor Jason Halford, a health behaviour expert at the University of Liverpool, said: 'Advertising does affect children in terms of what they purchase and reinforcing the brand.'But even beyond brand, our research has found it makes them grab the nearest sugary thing around, irrespective of their appetite.'  The couple aren't the only ones to feel the wrath of the Naked Chef in recent weeks. While at his Ministry of Food cookery school in Sydney, Australia, Oliver was drawn on his ongoing feud with Gordon Ramsay and couldn't resist stoking the embers.Oliver said of his one-time friend: 'He's just a ranter, he's paid to rant. He's paid to shower negativity and all his proteges don't talk to him because he's like that and it's a shame.'

{"i": "3ad0320476e8dda3a00604efdcf766e91766c815", "src": "Indiana's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately. After a firestorm of backlash and protests, Gov. Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the state will \"fix\" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians.Pence is making the right call. Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one. Not all people who dislike the law hate religion, and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the LGBT community. If people of good will come together, liberty and equality can both be saved.The unbelievably easy way to fix Indiana's RFRA is to add one small amendment, one easy line codifying that discrimination against the LGBT community is harmful, and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm.In general, it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations. As Americans, we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion.Sometimes, a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects, but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few. In those situations, if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption.Shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves; it simply sends the message that religion is important, and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why, people should be allowed to practice as they need.These are the reasons why the federal RFRA was passed in 1993, and why it had bipartisan support. These are wholesome American values that everyone can get behind. The problem is that we no longer live in 1993, 10 years before Lawrence v. Texas, and 20 before U.S. v. Windsor. In 1993, our sensibilities were different; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the LGBT community.Timing matters because society changes, and now that our horizons have been broadened we cannot just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago, before we realized its negative potential.Even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination, we still have to take seriously Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' claim about unintended consequences.To put it simply, you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with. The concern is real. Because Indiana does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate, and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief.Public perceptions matter. Whether or not lawmakers think so, it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in Baskin v. Bogans that Indiana's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional.Writing for the Seventh Circuit panel in 2014, Judge Richard Posner's rationale in the case of Baskin v. Bogan provides the obvious answer for how to fix the RFRA deficiency without changing what it is that it defends. Courts have long held that a religious exemption cannot be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party, and -- as Posner explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful.RFRAs are not inherently evil. The message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected. The principles of RFRA can remain unchanged; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves.A few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation, send an important message about the value of equality, and make Indiana into a shining beacon of cooperation: the real \"crossroads of America.\" Doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work.", "ref": " Gov.

In modernised condition, we would estimate they would sell for between \u00a32,750 and \u00a33,000 per sq/ft.'This gives the smaller property a \u00a36 million prices tag, while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth \u00a37.5 million.The current freeholder is thought to be The Welcome Trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and, for a 90-year lease, it is likely to cost between \u00a33.35 and \u00a34.5 million.Egerton Place was built off Michael's Grove by John Grover and Son to the designs of architect Mervyn Macartney around 1893. The properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the Egerton Gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets, finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange.Estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone 'hasn't stopped ringing' about the Egerton Place apartmentBut Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, had a warning to potential buyers: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease'Leases of all the homes were granted by the Smith's Charity trustees in 1894, and its first occupant was, Sir Evan MacGregor, permanent secretary to the Admiralty.Other residents of high status included the Dowager Lady Lawrence, probably the widow of the first Baron Lawrence, at No. 5, and Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, Q.C., son of the novelist Charles at No. 2.One property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases.Alex Newall, from Hanover Private Office, said: 'It looks cheap, but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease.'A developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder.'It is a very quirky situation. Properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like Knightsbridge.'I know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought 'right, I need to extend it', but by then it was too late and the extension was too much.'Let it be a warning to check your lease.'", "ref": " The Knightsbridge flat has been put on the market for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes, at \u00a3575,000.

Even after closing arguments, the motive is still unclear but not legally required to get a conviction. Still, jurors like to know a motive.Evidence collected in Lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. It's scheduled to begin in May, but officials say it will be pushed back.The trial has involved a complicated cast of characters, including two sisters who played important roles in the lives of Hernandez and LloydHere is a primer:Inside the case against Aaron HernandezOdin LloydOdin Lloyd was a 27-year-old semi-pro football player for the Boston Bandits.  He was found dead on June 17, 2013, less than a mile from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. He had been shot six times. Lloyd met Hernandez while dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Hernandez is charged with orchestrating Lloyd's execution.Daniel de Abreu and Safiro FurtadoDaniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado were killed outside a Boston nightclub on July 16, 2012. Earlier that evening, prosecutors say, de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez, spilling a drink.  Later that night, Hernandez was driving an SUV and allegedly pulled up alongside de Abreu and Furtado's car near the nightclub and fired a .38-caliber revolver at them, killing them. The trial judge in the Lloyd case barred any mention of the Boston deaths, ruling it would be prejudicial.Alexander BradleyAuthorities say  Alexander Bradley is Hernandez's former right hand man  who was allegedly with Hernandez  on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. He is not facing any charges in that case, but he is jailed on unrelated charges. He is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the face in February 2013, four months before Lloyd's death. Bradley says Hernandez accused him of \"disrespecting him\" over a cell phone left in a Miami strip club.  Bradley testified against Hernandez in Lloyd's death, telling jurors he saw Hernandez handling what appeared to be a Glock semi-automatic pistol during a trip to Florida. The trial barred him from saying he accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face.Carlos OrtizCarlos Ortiz, nicknamed Charlie Boy, is also charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty. A law enforcement source says he cooperated with police and described the night of Lloyd's death.Ernest WallaceErnest Wallace is also charged with murder in the death of Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty and is being tried separately.  Prosecutors call him the \"muscle man\" for Hernandez. They say he was in the car with Hernandez, Lloyd, and Carlos Ortiz an hour before the car is seen on video heading to the industrial park where Lloyd was killed.Shayanna JenkinsShayanna Jenkins is Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of their daughter. She is charged with perjury, accused of lying to a grand jury about guns in their home. She has pleaded not guilty. Her sister, Shaneah, was dating Lloyd at the time of his death.Shaneah JenkinsShaneah Jenkins is the girlfriend of Lloyd. Her sister is Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e. In court, the two sisters sit on opposite sides, Shayanna with the defense and Shaneah with the prosecution.Tanya Cummings-SingletonTanya Cummings-Singleton is a cousin of Hernandez. In her garage, police found the SUV allegedly driven by Hernandez and linked to the 2012 Boston double homicide. She was twice charged with contempt of court for refusing to testify before two grand juries despite immunity offers. She has pleaded guilty to obstruction in the Lloyd case. She is also suffering from cancer.Thaddeus SingletonThaddeus Singleton, husband of Tanya Cummings-Singleton, was killed in a car accident after Lloyd's slaying. Police say his speeding car went airborne and crashed. A source says police planned to interview him about his relationship with Hernandez.Shaquilla ThibouShaquilla Thibou is the sister of Lloyd. At trial she testified she saw her brother get into a car with three men who turned out to be Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz before he was killed. Prosecutors say she received a final text from her brother that night minutes before he was shot telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" The judge has ruled that text inadmissible at trial, saying there is no proof it meant Lloyd feared for his life.Terri HernandezTerri Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's mother. She is a school secretary.Dennis HernandezDennis Hernandez was Aaron Hernandez's father. He had a close relationship with his sons and was deeply involved in their sports training. He died unexpectedly after hernia surgery when Hernandez was 16.DJ HernandezDJ Hernandez is Aaron Hernandez's older brother. He was a star high school athlete. He also was a standout athlete at the University of Connecticut and is an assistant coach at the University of Iowa.The prosecutionDistrict Attorney Samuel Sutter, who had been leading the prosecution against Hernandez, is the newly elected mayor of Fall River, where the trial is being held. Assistant District Attorneys William McCauley and Patrick Bomberg are on the team leading the case against Hernandez.  \"Probably my career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done,\" Sutter has said.The defenseAttorneys James Sultan, Michael Fee and Charles Rankin are handling Hernandez's defense. In opening statements, Fee said Hernandez \"was planning a future, not a murder.\"  Before trial, Rankin said he is confident Hernandez will be exonerated.", "ref": " Jury selection for the Aaron Hernandez trial started back in January.

Queen Elizabeth II, pictured at Westminster Abbey yesterday. She placed 302nd on the Sunday Times Rich List with a wealth of \u00a3340m, compared with 285th last year and putting her outside of the top 300 for the first timeLen Blavatnick, pictured left with his wife Emily, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of \u00a313.2bn. Brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja were pushed into second placed as their wealth was valued at \u00a313bn1. Len Blavatnik \u00a313.17billion (Investment, music and media)2. Sri and Gopi Hinduja: \u00a313billion (Industry and finance)3. Galena and George Weston and family: \u00a311billion (Retailing)4. Alisher Usmanov: \u00a39.8billion (Mining and investment)5. David and Simon Reubeb: \u00a39.7billion (Property and internet) Today the wealthiest 1,000 people based in Britain are collectively worth \u00a3547billion, up from \u00a3258billion in 2009, an increase of 112 per cent.Those placed lowest on the 1,000 rankings have around \u00a3100million \u2013 \u00a345million more than in 2009 and \u00a315million more than last year, the biggest annual leap in 18 years.The findings are revealed in this year's Sunday Times Rich List, which consists of people who are British, who live and work in the UK, or who have 'strong links' to this country.The Queen's wealth grew modestly in the last year by \u00a310million to \u00a3340million, leaving her at number 302 \u2013 down from 285 in 2014. Almost three decades ago, when the list was first compiled, the Queen was placed at the top, with \u00a35.2billion.However, the rules of the list have changed to stop counting the value of assets such as the royal art collection, which could not be described as her personal wealth.Much of the rise in her income recently is down a record year for the Crown Estate in 2013-14, with profits of \u00a3267million. Under new financing rules, the 89-year-old monarch receives 15 per cent of the Crown Estate profits via the Sovereign Grant.  Lord Alan Sugar is a billionaire for the first time, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, while JK Rowling continues to earn from the Harry Potter franchise as well as her adult bestseller The Casual VacancyGeorge Clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer Amal means the couple's wealth also features at no. 790Roman Abramovich, the seventh wealthiest person in the UK according to the Rich List (right) speaks to Jose Mourinho, manager of Chelsea FC which he owns. Abramovich made his wealth through oil and industryAmong the new entries are Hollywood actor George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who married in September.Worth an estimated \u00a3121million, the pair are listed at number 790 above a number of super-wealthy businessmen and aristocrats.Other celebrities on the list include David and Victoria Beckham, as their joint wealth increases to \u00a3240million thanks to his sponsorship deals with Adidas and H&M.The footballer, 39, is now one of the country's leading philanthropists, with his latest project, 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund, aiming to raise \u00a37million for needy children in the next three years.Apprentice star Alan Sugar is now a billionaire for the first time, after his wealth increased by \u00a3140million to \u00a31.04billion. Blavatnik, pictured with singer Katherine JenkinsLen Blavatnik, a businessman and music mogul born in Ukraine, tops this year's Rich List with an estimated personal wealth of \u00a313.17billion.The 57-year-old built much of his fortune, which is up \u00a33.17billion on 2014, from Russian oil in an unlikely alliance with BP, but also bought Warner Music in 2011 and later added Parlophone, the Beatles' label, to his growing number of interests.The son of two Jewish academics, he emigrated to New York in 1978 and became a US citizen in 1984.Two years later, he started an investment company, Access Industries, and with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman he gained control of the oil producer TNK, partner of BP. When TNK-BP was sold in 2013, Blavatnik's share was more than \u00a34billion.Access's stakes in aluminium producer Rusal and chemicals firm LyondellBasell meant his wealth continued to grow.Blavatnik has two daughters and two sons with his American wife, Emily Appelson. At his 50th birthday party, she surprised him by dancing with a troupe of professionals in a Russian ballet. He owns a \u00a341million mansion in London's Kensington, recently paid $77million (\u00a350.7million) for a five-bedroom duplex in New York, and has donated \u00a375million to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government.Blavatnik's ten quoted and private company stakes are worth \u00a39billion. With \u00a33billion of cash, \u00a3440million of property and other assets, he is worth \u00a313.17billion.He may have just missed out on the top 100, but Lord Sugar is unlikely to be unhappy with his lot after becoming a billionaire for the first time this year.The 68-year-old businessman was ranked 101 in the Rich List for his \u00a31.04billion wealth.Lord Sugar, pictured with Apprentice winner Leah Totton, has \u00a3700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to \u00a3552m in 2013-14He was described by The Sunday Times as 'super-boss and master of the acerbic put-down' on The Apprentice.The BBC show first ran in 2005, with winners including Leah Totton, who triumphed in 2013, securing Lord Sugar's backing to open a cosmetic clinic.Lord Sugar has \u00a3700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to \u00a3552m in 2013-14.There are now 117 sterling billionaires based in Britain, up 12 per cent on last year, but only 62 are British \u2013 including Sir Richard Branson, Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley and Sir James Dyson.At the top of Britain's cash pile is Ukraine-born Len Blavatnik, who has investments in music, industry and media, and is worth \u00a313.17billion, up \u00a33.17billion on 2014.A Briton on the average annual wage of \u00a325,000 would need to work for 526,800 years to earn the same.At number two are India-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who have family interests in industry and global finance and are worth \u00a313billion. The Anglo-Canadian Weston family, who own Primark as well as Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason in London, are third with \u00a311billion.

'It's been scary, actually, as to how low our reservoirs have gotten ... so to even have this little bit, it's great.'Earlier in the day, the unusually cold spring storm brought heavy rain and hail to parts of Northern California and coated the mountains in snow - a welcome respite but one that will do little to ease the historic drought, forecasters say.The storm brought enough snow to the Sierra near Lake Tahoe to produce near white-out conditions on roadways and a string of traffic accidents that caused the California Highway Patrol to order motorists off a 15 mile-stretch of a major highway on Tuesday afternoon.In the Sierra, up to 6 inches of snow was expected above 7,000 feet, with 2 to 4 inches expected to accumulate as low as 3,000 feet before the system clears out Wednesday.Moving on: A man rides his bicycle around a flooded section of roadway as demolition continues in the background at Candlestick Park Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in San FranciscoMotorists on the CA-101 freeway face rainy weather in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The storm dumped rain in parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and promised three to four hours of steady rain later in the day to parts of Los Angeles CountyRainbow: A section of the California aqueduct with a rainbow in the background is pictured in Palmdale, CaliforniaMore than an inch fell on some counties in the San Francisco Bay Area, where rainy weather slowed the morning commute, caused some wrecks and led to wind advisories for four bridges, officials said.In Daly City, south of San Francisco, at least one car was submerged in rainwater that was flooding Interstate 280 on-ramps.In Fremont, a tractor-trailer jack-knifed before sunrise, blocking northbound Interstate 680 for several hours.Gilbert Jaffe, a retired Boeing engineer, was scooping up buckets of the stuff during brief rains Tuesday night and carrying it into barrels in his backyard near downtown Los Angeles.'I've been collecting water for a couple of years,' Jaffe said. 'I use the rainwater for my garden.'He said he'd been watering his tomatoes and peppers for six weeks with rain he collected during a bigger storm in February, and hoped his new take could continue his no-tap-water streak.Looming: Low clouds are pictured in La Canada Flintridge, California as rains moved south on TuedayDowned trees: Sacramento City Urban Forestry workers Enrique Gamez, left, and Ignacio Moreno remove a tree limb that has fallen into the street after a storm swept through SacramentoFans wait during a rain delay prior to a baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres on Tuesday in Los AngelesDodgers fan James Montelongo checks the radar during a rare rain delay prior to a game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres on the second day of the seasonFresno County Farmer Keith Nilmeier needs the rain for sure. Nilmeier grows 320 acres of citrus, peaches and wine grapes. The rain will force him to spray his trees with fungicide to keep fruit from rotting. But Nilmeier said it is worth the extra expense, because California needs the water.He expects the storm to drop up to half an inch, and with a little more he may have to irrigate one less time this summer.'That's farming,' he said. 'You deal with Mother Nature on her own terms.'The rain and snowfall is a big change from last week, when Gov. Jerry Brown, attending the last snowpack survey of the season, stood in dry, brown grass at a site normally covered in snow this time of year and announced he had ordered cities and towns to cut the state's overall water usage by 25 percent compared with 2013 levels. The snowpack makes its way into rivers and streams and provides 30 percent of the state's water.Sign of the times: A sign along Interstate 5 reading 'Stop the Congress Created DUST BOWL' is pictured in the Central Valley of California.

When play begins on Thursday, fans will have to put them back on the shelves.A Masters patron uses her camera to take photos of the action during the player practice rounds ahead of the 2015 Masters at Augusta National Golf Course in Augusta, Georgia, which starts on Thursday'Actually, the last time I had this out was Easter,' Wayne Watson said about the large black Nikon hanging around his neck.And the time before that?'No idea,' he said. 'Probably the Easter before.'More than a few of the fans lugging around similar equipment were, like Watson \u2014 who made the two-hour drive from Macon \u2014 experiencing Augusta National in person for the first time.Most just planned to mosey around until something caught their fancy. Some had general targets in mind \u2014 a favorite player or two, the trio of back-nine holes reverentially dubbed 'Amen Corner,' or the gigantic manual scoreboard alongside the first fairway.Then there was the occasional experienced big-game hunter, decked out with camera bags and an array of lenses.'I'm after Phil Mickelson,' said Kim McNeeley of nearby Aiken, South Carolina. 'I got a great shot of him the last time I was here \u2014 18 years ago.'But there are plenty of guys more serious than I am,' she added. The cell phone ban at the Augusta National Golf Club has forced fans to dust off their often unloved and rarely used old cameras if they want to capture a photo of their heroes like Tiger Woods'I had to borrow this from a friend who just had a baby. A few minutes ago, I saw a guy actually loading film into his camera. Film. Now that's old school.'Stepping back in time produced more than a few comical moments.Parked in lawn chairs behind the first tee, two pals leaned in close as one tried to figure out how to take a 'selfie' with a point-and-shoot camera \u2014 never mind that the term hadn't even been coined when the camera was originally manufactured. Behind the seventh tee, Kevin Davis of Gibson City, Illinois, recounted the preparations he went through to make sure his 4-year-old digital camera was ready to roll.First, he had to find it \u2014 'It took me awhile to remember where I left it,' he said, finally remembering it was in a desk drawer \u2014 and then make sure it was charged.'I've got a big camera, but I didn't want to lug that around,' Davis added. 'That's usually for family events.'Fans photograph Tiger Woods on their cell phones during a practice round for the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club South Course in Akron, Ohio, last JulyBut he might have had second thoughts when his twin 5-year-olds saw the camera and realized it wasn't a phone.'They were scratching their heads,' he recalled. 'They said, 'Daddy, why is it so big?''The fact that so many wound up opting for the big camera likely had to do with the number of serious hobbyists. While many planned to share their photos with friends on social media, a few planned to commemorate the trip with a photo album \u2014 talk about old-school \u2014 and in the case of Wes Rackley, make quality 8x10 framed prints and give them as presents.Few people, though, seemed as comfortable carrying around all the serious gear as Brett Pavel of Atlanta. He was at Augusta National for the 20th time \u2014 'I think that's right,' he said, 'because I've got at least 18 shirts \u2014 and said he has a camera around his neck at least once a week.'My wife calls it my \"pacifier,\"' he laughed, 'because our youngest son plays competitive soccer and she says taking pictures is the only thing that keeps me from cussing and yelling at the refs and everybody else.'", "ref": " Fans on the Georgia course have adapted by going back to the future and using their pocket-sized digital or their old 35mm cameras.

The MHOX Eye concept (above) is designed to replace and even enhance the vision compared to a normal eyeThe group plan to combine the biological tissue with microscopic wireless technology to provide additional functions and give super human eyesight.While currently still just a concept, the project raises the prospect of what bio-engineering may make possible in years to come.The team behind MHOX say their synthetic eyes, which include lenses that improves the image sharpness and can put filters over the vision, could be available by 2027.Scientists claim to have made a 'giant leap' towards creating 3D organs that could be simply printed out in hospitals when needed for a transplant.An international team have created the first organs that include a full vascular network for transporting blood through organs.They say it could even allows organs damaged by cancer to simply replaced.Scientists from the Universities of Sydney, Harvard, Stanford and MIT have now bio-printed artificial vascular networks mimicking the body's circulatory system that are necessary for growing large complex tissues. Using a high-tech 'bio-printer', the researchers fabricated a multitude of interconnected tiny fibres to serve as the mold for the artificial blood vessels.They then covered the 3D printed structure with a cell-rich protein-based material, which was solidified by applying light to it.Lastly they removed the bio-printed fibres to leave behind a network of tiny channels coated with human endothelial cells, which self organised to form stable blood capillaries in less than a week. Filippo Nassetti and Alessandro Zomparelli, the two Italian designers leading the project, said: 'Latest developments in bioprinting and biohacking let us imagine that in the near future it would be possible to easily print organic, functional body parts, allowing the human to replace defected districts or enhance standard performance.'This project is based on the idea of augmenting the sight sense, increasing the functionalities of the eye with ones currently handled by other body segments or external devices.'Under MHOX designs, patients with eye disease will inthe future be able to replace their eye with a synthetic one printed in a laboratory.For those looking to improve their vision, they could buy the 'Enhance' model that features a 'hyper retina' to give 15/10 vision - significantly better than normal 20/20 vision.They say it could also include a gland that can filter the visual signal to the brain by producing vintage or black and white effects much like a modern camera.They say these could be turned on or off by swallowing a pill that alters the state of this gland.The Eye Advance model adds a wifi connection that allows what the eye is seeing to be recorded and shared with others.It could also connect to external devices to act like a camera.They say a socket that connects the eye to the brain - which would require a surgical operation - would allow eyes to be interchangable.The synthetic eyes would come in three different models (above) according to the designs outlined by MHOXMHOX propose combining new technology like Wifi with bioprinting to produce an enhanced bionic eye The concept sounds a little like something out of the science fiction hit Blade Runner where bioengineers built new eyes for robotic replicants.Writing on their website, Mr Nassetti and Mr Zomparelli said: 'The installation of the EYE augmentations needs a first surgical operation aimed at installing the Deck, the technology that actually connects the eye to the brain.'After that, augmented eyes can be easily interchanged by their own users without the need of additional surgery.'Besides allowing to use different augmentations in different contexts, this system is suitable for easy hardware upgrade.'The designers say 3D bioprinters could be used to create the tissues to create the complex eye stucture", "ref": " Italian designers have unveiled a concept for a bio-printed synthetic eye.

It is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it.'I'm not just talking about Manchester City. You see Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - all the big clubs - they all do it. It is important to have big names.'Given the general disappointments of last summer's principle signings - Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala - Pellegrini's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash.But when pushed further, Pellegrini, perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain, would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned.Pellegrini still believes his Manchester City side are capable of retaining the Premier Legaue titleHe said: 'I don't want to talk about (plans) for next season because we have to finish this season. It is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players. So it is not the right moment to talk about it.'Pellegrini's immediate concern is his side's league position. Results elsewhere have seen City drop two places over the weekend and, although Pellegrini has not given up on the title, he clearly cannot even take the runners-up spot for granted.He said: 'Well we are not thinking about just one team. I think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we can't win the Premier League then we must try to be second.'But it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title.'", "ref": " Manuel Pellegrini believes Man City need to sign a world class superstar.

Gripped by what would later be diagnosed as a rare brain disorder, the 40-year-old crashed.She blamed her uncontrollable shaking in the aftermath of the accident on her shock.But over the following days, when she lost control of her bladder repeatedly, she feared something else was to blame.  Tests revealed she was suffering functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term for a wide variety of neurological symptoms that doctors cannot explain.  Samantha Rawcliffe, 40, from Morecambe, has been diagnosed with the rare condition functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term to cover a range of neurological symptomsThe mother-of-two suddenly lost all control of her body and crashed her car last May. In the days after the accident she lost control of her bladder and was shaking uncontrollably 'It wasn't a bad accident, but I went home shaken and had a drink,' she said. 'I just couldn't stop shaking.'The next day I wet myself and I wet the bed for the next three nights.'But I didn't know what was wrong with me, and thought I had a trapped nerve or something like that.'Even a year on, I have no feeling in my bladder, and I don't know when I need the toilet or even when I am actually weeing.'There is no sign that will ever return.'When I was told I had FND, I didn't even know what  it was and it just isn't out there, it's so rare.'  Following her accident on May 26, last year, Mrs Rawcliffe was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital to meet neurologists.They eventually diagnosed the rare illness functional neurological disorder in September, following a series of tests. Last September doctors diagnosed the rare brain disorder. Mrs Rawcliffe is now confined to her house, unable to walk and relies on a mobility scooter. Each day she has to take a cocktail of 32 different drugsMrs Rawcliffe, from Morecambe, has since had to give up her job as a teaching assistant, and can no longer drive.She struggles to walk further than eight metres, and relies on a mobility scooter to get around. Functional neurological disorder is an umbrella term that covers a variety of symptoms that cannot be explained.The condition can be as debilitating as Parkinson's disease and MS, and may share many common symptoms.Very few effective treatment plans exist.Physical therapy is often the most effective form of treatment, with the aim of reintroducing proper movement and motor control.Many patients are also prescribed cognitive behaviour therapy.The condition can cause the following symptoms:Source: FND Hope The 40-year-old spends most of her time confined to her home, and has to take 32 tablets each day to prevent choking fits and tremors.  'Life is quite boring and I can't do anything myself whether it's washing, showering, cooking cleaning,' she said.'Before I was diagnosed I was going to the gym five times a week and I loved my job.

Society demands that you should be punished.'He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard.Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there.He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited \u00a3500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier.Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money.  The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend \u00a315,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milkFrom there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans.But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon.Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear.In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life.'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.'Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him.'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said.

It should have been two shots better.\"Phil Mickelson powered around the course, threatening to challenge too, finishing on eleven under. As did a late Justin Rose surge, where he fired four birdies in a row to finish twelve under and in second place.In the end, there was lots of moving, but no one could move quick enough or far enough to trouble Jordan Spieth.InfallibleThe 21 year old has been nothing short of a sensation at Augusta.His infallible first two rounds gave the 21 year old from Dallas, Texas a five shot lead going in to the third round.That has happened only three times at Augusta before, and on all three occasions the leader has gone on to win.Spieth's 15 birdies are just 10 away from Phil Mickelson's Masters mark set in 2001. He could also break Tiger Woods 270 set in 1997.As it happened, Spieth played a steady, almost conservative round.When he made the occasional mistake, like the bogey at 15, he hit back straight away with a birdie next hole. As his third round came to a close the birdies flowed, his putting impeccable. The only nerves on show came during the last two holes with a double bogey at the 17.Echos of 1996?When reminded of some of the great Augusta comebacks, including Nick Faldo's 11 shot swing in 1996, Tiger Woods still believes anything is possible.\"It really is,\" he said. \"We saw what happened in 1996. You never know. It depends on the conditions.\"He is, of course, right.As Greg Norman knows only too well, anything can happen on the final day.But that kind of crescendo also depends on Spieth experiencing a Greg Norman-style meltdown.Spieth's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope.Yet, for all the movement of Mickelson, Woods, Rose and McIlroy, they made just a one shot dent into Spieth's second round lead.He will begin Sunday four shots ahead.", "ref": " Jordan Spieth holds lead in 2015 Masters.

But a snapshot of the tattoo is quickly helping the young father to gain national attention after it was shared on Imgur earlier this week.  And despite his critics' negative reactions to his tribute tattoo, Christien told Buzzfeed that he doesn't regret his decision to get the controversial ink, even claiming that he would happily get it done again.Bold statement: Christien Sechrist (pictured) has a large tattoo of his son's portrait on his own faceThe detailed portrait of the trainee electrician's son Perseus, which features his chubby cheeks and big eyes, takes up the entire left side of Christien's face, starting at the corner of his eyebrow and ending down by his chin. There is even some additional detail featured on his ear lobe.When he shared a picture of his new ink on his Facebook page last summer, Christien gave a shout out to the tattoo artist who designed the creation by thanking him for accurately rendering his son's image.'Thanks Cody Gibbs for doing awesome work on me. Looks just like my son,' he wrote.But Christien soon found himself being berated by his friend Ashlee Nicole who asked if the picture was a joke.After Christien confirmed that it wasn't, Ashlee expressed her frustration with his choice of location for the tattoo, noting that the ink would likely make it difficult for the young father to get a job in the future.'Why on your f****** face?! How are you ever going to get a real f***** job to support your son with a tattoo on your face?' she asked. Doting dad: The 20-year-old, from Houston, Texas (thought to be pictured with his son Perseus), insists that he has no regrets about his distinctive facial ink, and claims that his young son 'loves it'Snap a selfie: Christien has eagerly defended his facial ink to his friends on Facebook, many of whom questioned why he chose to get the tattoo in such an obvious location'It's not funny!' Ashlee continued. 'I'm going to make you come live with [me] so you don't do stupid sh** like this. Although it is a nice tat, you should have put it somewhere else.'Christien went on to call it a 'beautiful tattoo of a beautiful face on top of another beautiful face'.Meanwhile, another friend, David Overbey, predicted that regret would eventually set in. 'I give it [three] years before the regret starts [rolling] in,' he said, before noting: I'm not judging [though]. I think it's great work. But society frowns upon face tattoos.'Christien responded by saying: 'Well my son looked at it [and] smiled so that's all I care about.'Meanwhile, Derek Farmer argued that there are better ways to express his love for his son. Artistic expression: Christien already has a large tattoo design on the right of his face and the back of his head (pictured)Family ties: The doting dad posts numerous pictures of himself and his family on his Facebook account'You don't need a portrait of your child on your face to convince your love for him,' he wrote. 'It takes more than that.'Although not everyone was so judgmental.

{"i": "2df202fc6bfd639f30798b8369ab5140fcfe51d2", "src": "Europe's controversial new laws banning ultra-thin models from strutting down the catwalk may be doing more harm than good as models are reportedly going to extreme measures to ensure they clock in at a 'healthy' weight when they hop on the scale - including stuffing their underwear with sandbags.Earlier this month France passed a new law that bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low, in an attempt to combat anorexia. And the pressure is on for agencies who can face a fines of up to $80,000 and six months in prison for employing too-thin models.But former model Jennifer Sky, 38, from Brooklyn, New York, has revealed in an op-ed for the New York Observer that the fashion industry has already found a way around the regulations, explaining that thin models are now resorting to wearing weighted Spanx in order to cheat the new BMI standards. New kind of pressure: Former model Jennifer Sky, pictured in 2013 (R) and 2003 (L), has reported that models are being asked to wear Spanx underwear stuffed with sandbags, so they can clock in at a 'healthy' weight Different rules: Models can be seen walking down the runway at the Masha Ma show in March at Paris Fashion Week. France recently passed a law banning models from the catwalk if their body mass index is too lowAn anonymous model, referred to in the piece as 'Lauren', told Jennifer that she participated in Spanish Fashion Week, sometime after the country passed its new weight law in 2006 and recalled being asked to hide weights in her undergarments. 'They gave us Spanx underwear to stuff with weighted sandbags so the thinnest of girls had a \"healthy\" weight on the scales,' Lauren said. 'I even saw them put weights in their hair.'Jennifer went on to say that she hopes the US does not try to pass this 'discriminatory and misguided' because of its negative affect on naturally thin women. She noted that when she was a teenager she too would have been deemed underweight because BMI calculations, which are based on weight and height, don't take age, sex or genetic body shape into account.  'At 16, when I was working as a fashion model, I weighed 115 pounds and was 5'7\" 1/2,' she wrote. 'I exercised regularly and really loved to eat Subway veggie sandwiches and drink McDonald's vanilla milkshakes.'Major changes: Models can be seen strutting down the catwalk during the YDE show at Paris Fashion Week in March. Agencies who employ 'too-thin' models face large fines and even jail time under the new French lawShe continued: 'I was not anorexic or starving - I was definitely over-worked. I was simply a naturally thin teenager with a powerful teenage metabolic system.'Jennifer noted that as a teen with a BMI of 18.0, she would most certainly have been considered 'underweight'; while the exact BMI requirements for models working in France have not been released, the World Health Organization considers people with a BMI below 18.5 to be underweight and at risk of being malnourished.And while Jennifer says that, 22 years later her current measurements finally put her at a 'normal' 21.0, her BMI for most of her modeling career would have been deemed too dangerous for her to work under the new laws.While the model rights activist applauded the French government for attempting to protect the health of 'these young working professionals', she and Lauren both agreed that outlawing skinny altogether is not the answer.'I think a better solution is to raise the age limit for models to 18,' Lauren told Jennifer. 'Many ultra-thin models are simply still going through puberty, and allowing their bodies to form before their career would be beneficial to all.' Model rights activist: Jennifer spoke with Megan Alexander (R) about trafficking, abuse, and child labor problems within the fashion industry on Inside Edition in February Strict rules: The 38-year-old, who snapped this 'Post Fashion Week' selfie in February, noted her BMI would have been considered too low when she was a healthy 16-year-old model because she had a fast metabolism Jennifer added that instead of putting restrictions on the size of young models, the French government should 'look to the modeling agencies who freely act as employment agencies without the responsibilities of treating their client-models as working professionals'.Because models are considered independent contractors in the US, standard employment laws, which allow workers mandatory breaks, compensation for injuries and protection from sexual harassment, do not apply. Sara Ziff, who is a model and founder of The Model Alliance organization, told Think Progress in March that she is also against the new French law because legislating body mass standards is not the same thing as the fashion industry promoting a 'healthy ideal'. 'BMI suggests there are distinct categories of underweight, ideal, overweight and obese, with sharp boundaries that hinge on a decimal place, which is simply not true,' she explained. 'It is unfair and unreasonable to ban healthy models from working just because they have a relatively low BMI.'", "ref": " Former model Jennifer Sky, 38, claims that models are being asked to stuff their underwear with sandbags so they can clock in at a 'healthy' weight.

{"i": "c5dcaf5c23ff823fc9ab67eed14d82cdcf77bddb", "src": "Richie Benaud made commentary look easy. Believe me, it isn't. But he put in the hard work and he rose to the top. There's a lesson there for a few of the blokes who pick up a mic today.I had the great honour of doing a stint on Channel 9 in Australia during an Ashes Test a few years ago. They'd only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and, as usual, Richie was keeping his contributions to a minimum. I mean that in a good way \u2014 again, another lesson for today's batch.Anyway, Richie had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch, so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him. He wanted some footage of an incident he'd spotted a couple of overs earlier \u2014 Shane Warne had done something in the slips and it had passed the rest of us by.Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBCBenaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his later years in August 2005Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in TestsFinally, the producer located what he wanted. Warne, who hadn't bowled yet \u2014 but who would go on to skittle England for the umpteenth time \u2014 had picked up his bowling marker, a small white disc, and thrown it to where he thought he'd be starting his run-up.Between overs, they broadcast Warne's gesture. Richie said: 'Shane Warne's just put a marker down.'That was his only contribution in the half-hour we were on together, but it beat anything else we had to offer. One line! It was classic Richie: he had the eagle eye to see what Warne was doing in the first place, the confidence to stay quiet while we rabbited on, and the perfect choice of words. As he might have put it himself: marvellous.I thought of Richie during the World Cup final last month. For some reason Star Sports, the tournament's global broadcasters, used a team of rookies to commentate on the match.Some of them were among the game's greatest modern-day players, but it was painfully apparent none of them had done much commentary. It was terrible TV. They just couldn't pinpoint the moment \u2014 no emotion, no elation, no despair. How we missed Richie that evening. He never went overboard but he could have captured all those qualities in that understated way of his. Sometimes he could be very understated indeed.David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silenceAustralia cricket legend Benaud shakes hands with HM Queen Elizabeth II during his playing daysI remember talking to Michael Slater, who teamed up with him in the commentary box in his later years. He spoke about one day when Richie did two half-hour stints as one of three commentators, and did not say a single word.Slats described it as 'bagging a pair', the term for a batsman who gets two ducks. But that was Richie. If there was nothing to add to the picture the viewers could see, he wouldn't add to it.It really pains me now, for example, when commentators start reading out a graphic that has appeared on screen for all to see. It might be the top 10 leading runscorers at a particular ground, or something similar, and they just read out the list! It's incredibly lazy.Richie would consider the list, and then say something like: 'And No 4 could soon be moving to No 2.' He wouldn't even name names \u2014 he respected the intelligence of the viewer. And I know how much viewers responded to that.One of his best qualities was that he never sought the limelight. He wasn't in it for the ego. He'd turn up in the commentary box and if he was off-air, he'd set up at the back of the box, take out his computer and do his homework on the newest player on the scene, or look up the latest horseracing odds.The chemistry he had with the likes of Tony Greig and Bill Lawry was amazing. It was unmissable. And it was based on a deep mutual respect and love of the game.Benaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his leg spinBenaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and lovedBenaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005And, boy, he loved the game. One evening, Richie, Ron Atkinson and I were treated to dinner in Birmingham by the News of the World, who we were all working for at the time. Ron was covered in bling and telling us all how he could get into any nightclub in town and was ready for a lively evening.Richie wasn't a big drinker, but he'd allowed himself a couple of glasses of red, and he started telling this story about the great Australian leg-spinner Bill O'Reilly. It's fair to say the story was on the longish side and by the time Ron had disappeared into the night and Richie was being bundled into a waiting taxi, we were still learning all about Bill O'Reilly\u2026He had this wit that made all other commentators want to be like him. He didn't really go in for after-dinner speaking, but he might occasionally be asked to say a few words.Once he spotted me in the audience, and quickly remembered the time I was hit in the groin by Jeff Thomson (have I mentioned that before?).Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84'Ah, there's David Lloyd,' Richie said. 'I remember him telling me in 1974-75 how he could play Thommo with his c***\u2026 and then he proceeded to do precisely that.' The joke was all in the pause and the timing.He was a great leg-spinner, a superb captain, and a lovely bloke. I can just imagine how warmly he'll be welcomed by some of the other great commentators up in the sky: Brian Johnston, Alan McGilvray, John Arlott, even Freddie Trueman.Fred was often known to splutter: 'I just don't know what's going off out there.'Richie, it's safe to say, never suffered from the same affliction. We'll miss him dearly. And so will cricket.ON COMMENTATING 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.''My mantra is: put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.''The key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see.''Out in the field, you haven't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things, you've got to do it yourself.'ON CAPTAINCY 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.''Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.'ON BATTING'Bruce Reid is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the Myer Music Bowl to hold a convention.''Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.''He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.'ON BOWLING'A bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner.''Your wrist must be cocked, but not stiffly cocked.''You must always look where you want to land it. If I offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can, you'd never take your eyes off it.'ON TWENTY20 CRICKET'If any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it's great for the sport. I think it's wonderful.''As long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game I think it will be terrific.'ON SHANE WARNE'S 'BALL OF THE CENTURY'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn't know.'ON 1981's 'UNDERARM BOWLING' SCANDAL'A disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong. It should never be permitted to happen again. One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field.'MISCELLANEOUS'The slow-motion replay doesn't show how fast the ball was really travelling.''A cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it.''He's usually a good puller - but he couldn't get it up that time.''Cricket has changed for the better ... it's because of what happened then, cricket is so strong now.'", "ref": " Former Australia captain and commentator Benaud passed away  aged 84.

{"i": "9b669b6b76140de3fa14987bbbba7c15242752ce", "src": "SKYFARINGby Mark Vanhoenacker(Chatto & Windus \u00a316.99)Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz.The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker's book, unwittingly, very timely indeed.When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets.Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life.But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience.Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his jobVanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our 'historic relationship with aviation'.Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights \u2014 exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye.Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia's great blue heron as 'the 747 of the swamp' and notes how this would delight the aircraft's chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more 'a place' than a conveyance.Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the 'frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better \u2014 everything looks better \u2014 when your feet are warm'.He writes elegantly about his pilot's eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country.Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth's surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent.But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys.Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And 'meet' really means 'meet': air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, 'our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.'Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there's anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as 'Klingons'.Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as 'the heavy', one acting as 'heavy out', the other as 'heavy home'.And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters.These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker's home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region's prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city's more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek.But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX.

That same year, he had sex with a woman too inebriated to give her consent, prosecutors say.Despite admitting his guilt in December, D.C. prosecutors on Friday asked that Williams be spared prison time because he is himself the victim of a crime - the effects of which will mar the remainder of his life, Washington Post reports.No jail time: Former Capitol Hill staffer Donny Ray Williams is disfigured from an acid attack that occurred years after he raped two women. A judge on Friday agreed with a prosecutor's recommendation that he not serve jail time due to his serious injuries, for which he's undergone 20 surgeries and still faces more life threatening operations The decision to give Williams a suspended jail sentence and 5 years probation - which Judge Robert E. Morin reluctantly agreed to - came despite one of his victim's request he be given 'some jail time.' 'He gave me a random dose of drugs and risked my life,' the woman argued in a letter read in D.C. Superior Court last week.The woman had just moved to Washington as an intern. She initially warmed to Williams because she believed he could help her get a leg up on Capitol Hill. 'After the assault, I moved away, and he continued to harass me and threatened me to drop the charges. This crime has caused me fear, pain and a financial burden,' she wrote.The other woman Williams raped was not present for the sentencing, during which Judge Morin said Williams 'was a victim of an independent crime and has serious medical issues.'Williams' own attack occurred in 2013 as he walked down a Washington street.A man approached him and tossed acid in his face that dripped down his body, he told the Post.'I thought I was going to die,' Williams recalled.Acid attack: Williams was approached by a man in 2013 on a Washington street who tossed acid on his face. He believes a former girlfriend's jealous ex was behind the attack. He's now blind in one eye and nearly blind in the otherMassive second and third-degree burns put him in the hospital for two months, blinded him in one eye and nearly blinded him in the other.Williams believes the jealous boyfriend of a woman he was dating was behind the assault, the Post reports. Much of his face is now gnarled and disfigured and he currently has a massive lump at the top of his skull where doctors have surgically implanted a rod that stretches his skin in order to promote healing.He's undergone some 20 surgeries and still faces more 'life threatening surgeries.'How easy it is for men to use power to abuse,' Williams said in court. 'Rape is cowardly, shameful and downright evil. I promise, I will protect a woman's right to her own body.'He'd previously denied the allegations against him, saying he only pleaded guilty because he wanted to focus on his health and not a trial.He now says he's a $1 million in debt and jobless after spending years working with such notable politicians as Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator Herb Koh. He worked in the Obama administration as the general deputy assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental relations in the Department of Housing and Urban Development between April 2009 and October 2010.Williams had served as a staff director for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. He started working on Capitol Hill in 1999 for Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.).", "ref": " Donny Ray Williams on Friday was given a suspended sentence and 5 years probation for two 2010 sexual assaults.

Plague is still contracted by as many as 2,000 people a year, according to the World Health Organization, though the vast majority of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar.Prairie dogs are particularly susceptible to illness because they live in social burrows, and 90 per cent of the furry creatures' colony can eventually be wiped out if plague infects one member.The disease's rodent host dies, when fleas will look for more blood to drink, including from people.The vast majority of human plague cases reported in the US are in the arid climate of the Southwest, which scientists say is similar to the disease's homeland of Central AsiaThe discovery of the disease at Picture Canyon (pictured) has prompted a warning from authorities about the dangers posed by dead rodentsInsecticide has been sprayed in prairie dog burrows in Picture Canyon to halt the plague's spread. Symptoms of pain in humans include fever, chills and muscle pain.At later stages it causes gangrene and a large amount of pustules, or buboes, on the skin. The incubation period could be up to seven days. Modern medications are effective in fighting the plague, also known by its bacterial name Yersinia pestis,  though it can be deadly if left untreated. The last plague epidemic in the United States was in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1925, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Plague originally came to North America via rodents on steamships from Asia.

It's called The Forgotten Man.One of many critics of Blair's appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: 'Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.'Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned \u00a3303,000 in addition to his MP's salary, mostly from \u00a31,600-an-hour appearances on Iran's Press TV and Russia Today. The national treasure that is Andrew Marr gets to the heart of what is wrong with the election campaign.'There's this thing called the deficit sitting there like a great stinking ordure in the middle of public life. To deal with it, big taxes have to go up. The Tories seem to have forgotten that,' he writes in The Spectator. 'They now want to spend huge extra amounts of money on the NHS; Labour has ruled out almost all tax rises for most voters. The other parties want to spend more and don't want to talk about taxation.'The deficit? Apparently if it's left alone it's just going to melt away. Huddled-down, risk-averse politicians from all the main parties have decided to treat us like credulous children.'Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's 'Controls On Immigration' mug embarrassing Dermot Murnaghan brandished Labour's embarrassing 'Controls On Immigration' mug at the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper in her Sky News interview yesterday. Cooper coolly took the mug and cleverly turned the slogan away from the cameras. 'A storm in a coffee cup,' Cooper, aka Mrs Ed Balls, said.The influential Labour Uncut blog says Defence Secretary Michael Fallon's claim that Red Ed Miliband 'stabbed his own brother in the back' to lead Labour, and would do the same to Britain by negotiating away Trident, will help the Tories.'The manner in which Ed Miliband defeated his brother is regularly brought up on the doorstep with Labour canvassers and crystallises discomfort with the idea of Ed Miliband as an untrustworthy leader,' the website says. 'The gutter is an ugly place to be but. . . it's where elections are won.' Plaid Cymru is under pressure to dump its candidate for Ceredigion, Mike Parker, for saying in 2001 English-born inhabitants of rural Wales were 'gun-toting final solution crackpots'.

{"i": "12b15be31234c6dd417a09ce0915e896391df4b4", "src": "The U.S. Supreme Court'sarguments on Tuesday over same-sex marriage will cap more thantwo decades of litigation and a transformation in publicattitudes.Based on the court's actions during the past two years, asense of inevitability is in the air: That a majority is on theverge of declaring gay marriage legal nationwide.Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's pivotal member on gayrights, has been marching in this direction with opinions datingto 1996. In his most recent gay rights decision for the court in2013, rejecting a legal definition of marriage limited to a manand woman for purposes of federal benefits, Kennedy deploredthat U.S. law for making gay marriages 'unequal.'Scroll down for video A moment in history: People line up outside the Supreme Court in Washington April 26 ahead of Tuesday's arguments focusing on gay marriageThat 5-4 decision did not address a constitutional right tosame-sex marriage, but lower court judges interpreted the rulingas an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans.When states appealed rulings striking down their same-sexmarriage prohibitions, the Supreme Court declined to intervene,most notably in October 2014 when it denied appeals in sevencases on a single day.Instead, the nine justices are hearing in Tuesday's oralarguments an appeal of the sole decision from a regional U.S.appeals court that went the opposite way. Last November, theCincinnati-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuitupheld gay marriage bans in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky andTennessee.With 37 of the 50 states now permitting gay marriage, manybecause of judicial orders, it seems unlikely the country'shighest court would reverse course. Public opinion polls overthe last decade have shown large increases in support for gaymarriage. A ruling is due by the end of June. Yet some questions remain.How much will Kennedy, a member of the court's five-manconservative bloc who often casts decisive votes in close cases,show his hand in the 2-1/2 hours of oral arguments? Will hereveal a clear view that the Constitution gives gay people aright to marry or will he voice concerns for state interests incontrolling marriage laws?An element of uncertainty hovers over Chief Justice JohnRoberts, who broke with the other court conservatives and castthe deciding vote upholding President Barack Obama's healthcarelaw in 2012. Roberts voted against gay rights in the 2013ruling. But he separated himself from the most conservativedissenters and declined to declare outright that states may bangay marriage.He has demonstrated apprehension about the reputation of thecourt that, by virtue of his service as chief justice,informally bears his name. In his opinions, he has sometimestried to lower tensions in controversial cases and reassurepeople that the court is aligning with precedent and publicexpectations.The question is not only how Roberts might vote but what hemight write.In the 2013 ruling, he denounced the court majority'ssentiment that federal lawmakers were deliberately harming gaypeople with the limited definition of marriage. 'I would not tarthe political branches with the brush of bigotry,' he wrote.For the other seven justices, expectations are clearer.The four liberals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer,Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, have signaled their oppositionto state same-sex marriage bans. On the other side have been thethree most conservative justices, Antonin Scalia, ClarenceThomas and Samuel Alito, asserting that nothing in theConstitution guarantees same-sex marriage.Two legal questions are before the justices: whether theConstitution's guarantees of due process and equal protectioncover a right to same-sex marriage; and, if they do not, whetherstates that ban same-sex marriages must recognize such unionsperformed in other states.Gay couples and their families, about 30 adults and 20children, have appealed the 6th Circuit's decision. The namepetitioner is James Obergefell, who wanted his home state ofOhio, which prohibits gay marriage, to recognize his Marylandmarriage to John Arthur as Arthur was dying from amyotrophiclateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.Officials expect the courtroom to be packed to its 400-seatcapacity.

Professor Hawking, 73, appeared on film alongside Professor Brian CoxProfessor Hawking can be heard singing the show's famous song, which is being released digitally this week, and available on vinyl this weekend as part of Record Store Day 2015. In the video, Professor Hawking 'runs over' Professor Brian Cox before taking to the sky and making his trip through the universe.The video is interspersed with clips of Monty Python's recent live shows.It is a recreation of the song from the 1983 film Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, when Eric Idle originally took viewers on a journey through the cosmos.Interestingly, much of the science in the song is right - or at least, fairly accurate, with a few exceptions for artistic reasons.For example, the lyrics state that Earth is 'revolving at nine hundred miles an hour.'Measured in nautical miles, this is true, but the current estimate near the equator is actually 1,040mph (1,670km/h).It is also stated that 'the sun is the source of all our power,' which fails to consider that geothermal energy and the moon both also play a part in our planet's life.Our galaxy is correctly said to have a hundred billion stars, though, while its size - a hundred thousand light-years across - is correctly stated.Towards the end of the song, the speed of light is said to be 12 million miles per minute - which is pretty close to the actual figure of 11.16 million miles.Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. BrownAnd things seem hard or toughAnd people are stupid, obnoxious or daftAnd you feel that you've had quite enough Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolvingAnd revolving at nine hundred miles an hourThat's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckonedA sun that is the source of all our power The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can seeAre moving at a million miles a dayIn an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hourOf the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way' Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion starsIt's a hundred thousand light years side to sideIt bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thickBut out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central pointWe go 'round every two hundred million yearsAnd our galaxy is only one of millions of billionsIn this amazing and expanding universe The universe itself keeps on expanding and expandingIn all of the directions it can whizzAs fast as it can go, the speed of light, you knowTwelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecureHow amazingly unlikely is your birthAnd pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space'Cause there's bugger all down here on EarthPictured here are Eric Idle (left), Stephen Hawking (centre) and Brian Cox.

Andrew Strauss (right) says the Kevin Pietersen affair is a 'distraction' for English cricketStrauss and Pietersen pictured during happier times during the 2011 series with India Yet his hopes of an England return would seem over if Strauss succeeds in becoming the new England director of cricket after throwing his hat into the ring on Friday.'It's very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation,' said Strauss, who infamously called Pietersen 'a complete c***' on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off. 'That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than him actually playing. It's become that big. The ECB and the England team's efforts to move on from him haven't worked so far but by winning that will allow them to move forward.'Strauss's views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one, even though his feelings towards Pietersen clearly have not changed.'If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after the Ashes is over, it's quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side,' Strauss told Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth on the Lord's podcast. 'You're building towards the next Ashes in two and a half years time and the World Cup in 2019. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey for the county season in an attempt to regain his England place Pietersen's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of Michael Vaughan in the new ECB director of cricket role created following the sacking of Paul Downton as managing director'I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can't see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time. I think after the Ashes the story does move forward at that point.'Michael Vaughan remains favourite to pip Strauss for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in English cricket since Ray Illingworth in the Nineties.Graves and new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison want to overhaul the system and make the new man more the equivalent of a football manager than a managing director, as was Downton.That means the director of cricket will probably be a hands-on presence in the dressing room with overall responsibility for coaching and selection, with the panel of selectors almost certainly being disbanded.There were key figures who wanted Strauss to take the job when Hugh Morris stood down 18 months ago, not least the Welshman himself, but at that stage Strauss felt it was too early for him and he has dabbled in commentary while not being a natural at it like Nasser Hussain and Atherton. Pietersen and Vaughan pictured together on England duty at Lord's in 2008Strauss, who played in 82 Tests with Pietersen, believes his recall would only be a short-term measureNow the new regime at the ECB have moved the goalposts and the man Graves and Harrison want is clearly Vaughan, if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests.Vaughan is here to commentate on England's three-Test series against West Indies for Test Match Special and intriguingly is staying at the same hotel as the team.It will be fascinating to see whether he changes a hard-hitting commentary style that has seen him criticise several of the players who he may well now take charge of, with the ECB looking to make a quick appointment.Vaughan will need to build some bridges himself with a number of England players if he takes over but clearly Graves is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow Yorkshireman is perfect for the role.Jimmy Anderson, who will be playing his 100th Test needing four wickets to become England's leading wicket-taker, did not want to get drawn into which of his former England captains should get the big job. England bowler Jimmy Anderson refused to be drawn on who he would prefer to take up the role'I don't really have an opinion because we're concentrating on building up to a Test,' said Anderson. 'That's for the two new guys in charge. They've obviously got a clear plan of where they want to take English cricket and I'm sure they'll get the right man for the job.'Even though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that Anderson then named Hussain and Strauss as the best captains he has worked under, a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 Ashes-winning captain Vaughan.Clearly, Peter Moores and even Alastair Cook will be almost auditioning for Vaughan in this series and it is impossible to see Moores in particular carrying on as coach alongside a man in Vaughan who has been so critical of him.The distractions that Strauss talked about, not just those provided by Pietersen, clearly still loom large over an England team who, it should be remembered, won the last three Tests they have played.It is imperative, not least for their captain and coach, that they continue that run here.", "ref": " Former skipper Strauss says Pietersen return is out of the question.

JWST's main mirror will be 21ft (6.5 metres) in diameter, three times as large as Hubble's.There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy \u2013 and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them.During a talk in Washington earlier this month, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade.'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, said.'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.'Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.''We are not talking about little green men,' said Stofan. 'We are talking about little microbes.'The announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places.Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep.A joint project of Nasa, the European and canadian space agencies, JWST will carry four instruments, including cameras and spectrometers that can capture extremely faint signals.Infra-red capability will help it observe distant celestial bodies, and its camera shutter will be able to remain open for long periods, explained Matt Greenhouse, JWST project scientist for the science instrument payload.'The Webb will have 70 times the light-gathering capacity of Hubble. So the combination of the large size and the infra-red capabilities will allow us to observe this epic of the universe past,' he said in an interview.Even more, the telescope should further the search for life elsewhere in the universe by opening a new window on planets outside the solar system  that might have water.Already, Nasa's Kepler Space telescope, launched in 2009, has helped astronomers identify thousands of exoplanets. JWST is expected to propel that research even further.'Webb is quite big enough to have a high probability of finding bio signatures in the atmosphere of exoplanets, evidence of life,' Greenhouse said.'We have sensors on board, equipment on board that will enable us to study the atmosphere of exoplanets spectroscopically. So we will be able to understand the composition of those atmospheres,' he added.'We can make big progress in the search for life.'Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which circles the Earth, the JWST will go even further, to a place called L2, for LaGrange Point, 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away in space.That distance will keep the telescope cold, prevent it from being blinded by its own infra-red light and shelter it from radiation.'It will follow the Earth around the sun over the course of the year. So it's in a sun center orbit instead of an Earth center orbit,' said Greenhouse.The heavy telescope is scheduled to launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket, made by the European Space Agency, from French Guiana in October 2018.'Just as Hubble rewrote all the textbooks, Webb will rewrite it again,' said Greenhouse.Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, which circles the Earth, the JWST will go even further, to a place called L2, for LaGrange Point, 930,000 miles (1.5 million km) away in spaceThe distance will keep the telescope cold, prevent it from being blinded by its own infra-red light and shelter it from radiationThe heavy telescope, pictured here during testing, is scheduled to launch atop an Ariane 5 rocket, made by the European Space Agency, from French Guiana in October 2018", "ref": " Nasa is on track to launch the James Webb telescope in three years.

MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1)JOE HART 6 - The England goalkeeper couldn't have wished for a quieter 28th birthday, and was rarely called into action by a toothless West Ham. PABLO ZABALETA 6.5 \u2013 Treated for bloody nose early on but that was about the extent of the damage inflicted on City. Got forward well as usual. Manchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta keeps Enner Valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge MARTIN DEMICHELIS 6 \u2013 Careless slip let in Carlton Cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in Mangala. ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7 - Dominant display from City's \u00a332million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble-free return to the line-up, and snuffed out the few threats offered by the Hammers. ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV 6.5 \u2013 Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. FRANK LAMPARD 6 \u2013 Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West HamFERNANDO 6.5 \u2013 Didn't have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate's burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. JESUS NAVAS 8 \u2013 Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City's first two goals. Jesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad StadiumYAYA TOURE 7 \u2013 A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City's second goal. DAVID SILVA 6.5 \u2013 Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. SERGIO AGUERO 7.5 \u2013 The Argentine's third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can't argue with that. Sergio Aguero celebrates with City team-mates Navas and Yaya Toure after putting his side 2-0 upManchester City ace Sergio Aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th Premier League goalSubs: Caballero, Sagna, Boyata, Fernandinho (for Lampard 88), Nasri (for Silva 75, 6), Dzeko (for Aguero 90+1), Pozo.Scorers: Collins og 18, Aguero 36Booked: Navas, Silva WEST HAM (4-1-4-1)ADRIAN 6 \u2013 Had little chance with either of City's goals, particularly Collins's own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. CARL JENKINSON 6 \u2013 One of West Ham's better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. JAMES COLLINS 5 \u2013 Won't enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva \u2013 but not quite. West Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead WINSTON REID 5.5 \u2013 Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans.AARON CRESSWELL 5.5 \u2013 After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times.ALEX SONG 5 \u2013 Had his hands full trying to screen West ham's defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second.Alex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute CHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 \u2013 His arm into Silva's face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise.MARK NOBLE 5 \u2013 Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all.STEWART DOWNING 4.5 \u2013 Lost the ball in the build-up to City's second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all.ENNER VALENCIA 6 \u2013 Anonymous in the first half but picked up a bit after the interval and had West Ham's best effort with a fine individual run and shot.CARLTON COLE 4.5 \u2013 Was gifted the Hammers' best opportunity in the first half but took too long to get a shot off. Struggled with little service and replaced by Nolan.Carlton Cole failed to impress on his first start  since his side's 0-0 draw with Southampton in FebruarySubs: Nolan (for Cole 66, 6), Jarvis (for Song 66, 6), Nene, O'Brien, Amalfitano, Jaaskelainen, Burke.Booked: Kouyate, DowningReferee: Anthony Taylor 6.5Star man: Jesus Navas", "ref": " Man City bounced back from derby defeat with 2-0 win over West Ham .

This number represents about half the world leaders that Russia has said it invited to the celebrations.Kim's trip had been anticipated since late December, when Russian state media reported that Moscow had extended an invitation.There was no further explanation, from Moscow or Pyongyang, as to why he wouldn't head west.Still, North Korea has a number of issues it's been wrestling with for years. They include widespread poverty, its longstanding spat with neighboring South Korea and the United States, as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program.And news about Kim's non-visit comes a day after South Korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that Kim is ruling with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year.CNN cannot independently confirm the executions detailed by Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy who attended the closed briefing.  And the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear.That said, North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the world.And there's little doubt that Kim is very much in charge.

Goldstein and Stimler were also convicted on charges of attempted kidnapping.The rabbis were part of a ring accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars to orchestrate the kidnappings of Jewish husbands to persuade them through torture involving electric cattle prods and screwdrivers to grant \"gets,\" a document that Jewish law requires a husband to present to his wife in order to be issued a divorce, court papers said.The men were arrested in October 2013 following an FBI sting operation that ended with Goldstein, Stimler and six other men with ski masks, surgical blades and a 30-foot nylon rope in a warehouse in Middlesex County, New Jersey.Lawyers for each of the rabbis told CNN they plan on appealing the convictions.\"Rabbi Epstein still firmly believes that he was protecting women's rights and was protecting the agunahs and the families,\" said Robert Stahl, the lawyer for Epstein.Without a \"get,\" a woman is considered an \"agunah,\" a chained woman bound to a man no matter how over the marriage might actually be.An Orthodox Jewish woman who does not receive a get runs the risk of being shunned in her community and labeled an adulteress if she moves on. Any future children she has are considered bastards permitted to marry only other bastards.\"I don't think this was a traditional kidnapping,\" said Aidan O'Connor, the lawyer for Goldstein.Goldstein is a sofer, a Jewish scribe who transcribes the Torah and writes other religious documents, including divorce papers, his attorney said.Nathan Lewin, the attorney for Stimler, called the verdict \"shocking\" and said his client was only present at the warehouse as a witness for the ceremonial signing of the document.\"There's no evidence that Rabbi Stimler knew what was going to be going on,\" Lewin said. \"Of course we're going to take all the steps to correct this injustice.\"Epstein's son, David Epstein, was acquitted on Tuesday of kidnapping charges.The jury returned not guilty verdicts on the attempted kidnapping charges against Mendel Epstein, and on more severe kidnapping charges against the three rabbis.Nine other individuals previously pled guilty in the case to conspiracy charges, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey.Henry Mazurek, the lawyer for David Epstein, said his client was grateful for the jury's decision but called his client's acquittals \"bittersweet\" next to his father's conviction.\"He really believes that (his father) was a champion of someone who was voiceless in his religion,\" Mazurek said.Sentencing is set for July 15.

They were given 20 minutes to wolf down whatever their parents had packed for them and 20 minutes to play.In 2009, Lisa and her husband made the move to France and she began working as a substitute teacher in Paris. Writing in her blog - Canadian Expat Mom - the 34-year-old said: 'I'll never forget dreading the fact that I was on lunchtime supervision because I saw that fish was on the menu that day.'I had been a teacher for long enough to know that there was going to be a lot of elementary school kids plugging their noses and telling me they didn't like fish. This was going to be a long supervision period.'But those children proved her wrong - they didn't turn up their noses and even asked for seconds.Scroll down for video Speaking to MailOnline from her home in the Aquitaine region of southern France, she said: 'That's when I first encountered kids eating whatever was being put in front of them. 'I was shocked because it wasn't necessarily what I wanted to eat.'Fast forward five years to 2014, and Lisa had her own daughter to get ready for her first day at school. At three years old, she enjoyed a healthy continental diet but refused to eat vegetables.Three-course meal: Lisa Webb was nervous about sending her vegetable-phobic child to a school where pupils eat what they are served'Initially I think that we did give her everything, we eat very healthily as a family,' Lisa explained. 'Even if we wanted to give our kids fast food it doesn't really exist. Fast food for us is grabbing a baguette and a chunk of cheese. 'She ate everything but vegetables - foie gras, saucisson, lapin (rabbit). At home I stopped offering her broccoli because I didn't like wasting food.'I was a little bit nervous. I thought \"there is no way she can stay at school, she will be starving\".'Writing in her blog, she added: 'Each week I would head over to the bulletin board posted outside the school and check what they were eating for lunch. There wasn't a burger and fries or chicken finger to be seen on the list.'It all sounded so fancy. Was Julia Child working in the kitchen? How were they serving this to three-year-olds? Did they have a magic wand to get these kids to eat this very grown up list of food?'Whenever I would come across the ladies that worked in the lunchroom, I would stare in disbelief as they would tell me what a good eater my daughter was. 'Were they sure they had the right kid? Because mine would barely touch a vegetable at home. Yet, she wasn't coming home hungry, so she must have been eating something.''There's no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates,' Lisa wrote. 'The kids are served their meal at the table, not buffet style'When the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime, where there is a constantly changing menu of salads, seasonal vegetables, meats and fish, the mum-of-two jumped at the chance.'There's no plastic cutlery or non-breakable plates,' she wrote. 'The kids are served their meal at the table, not buffet style. 'This is France after all, where the gastronomic meal is protected as a UNESCO intangible world heritage item. There's no messing around when it comes to the French and eating.'All the kids ate what was served and there is no food brought from home. Each day at lunch there was a three-course meal; no exceptions. 'The kids came into the lunchroom and sat politely using their manners, just like little adults. 'They were always offered seconds when they were done, and not forced to eat something they didn't like, yet always encouraged to try it. Not liking something didn't happened often though.'However, if someone didn't like something there wasn't a fuss made, their plate was cleared and the next course was served.'When the opportunity arose to spend a week in the canteen at lunchtime the mum-of-two jumped at the chanceThe meal at the French state school costs parents just \u20ac2.60 (\u00a31.90) each day.'I think a big part of it is that they are with their friends and they see all the other kids eating the same thing,' she told MailOnline. 'There is no jealousy of what everyone else has. 'I think it's amazing and it makes me happy that my kids are going to school here. 'Since we have lived here we go out for dinner and see kids eating in restaurants. You don't see them with a kids' menu or colouring in front of them.'I think they learn it from when they are three years old. 'My daughter eats a lot more and it was a good eye-opener for me to see what she will eat. She gets vegetables every night.' Lisa, who is writing a book about life in France, added: 'My eyes have been opened and I am amazed by the what the French public school system does daily at noon. Well done France.'

The seven-minute expertly edited video, purportedly shows Islamic State destroying the relics before bulldozing and blowing up the ruins, completely obliterating the historic site.The destruction at Nimrud, which took place last month, follows other attacks on cultural heritage sites carried out by the Islamic State, which now holds a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate.Scroll down for video Attack: An ISIS militant uses a sledgehammer to destroy a several thousand years old stone slab in a video allegedly showing the group's attack on the ancient ruins of the city of Nimrud, near Mosul, IraqAs well as attacking the city by hand, hammer and drill, the video shows the group making barrel bombs which they lined up along the ancient relics inside the ruins of what was once the capital of the Assyrian Empire, founded some time in the 13th century B.C.ISIS released the video, believed to have been filmed last month, showing militants smashing artifacts in the historic city, which is on UNESCO's tentative list of world heritage sites, before blowing it upThe attack on the ancient site horrified archaeologists when it was first reported last month, and has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.The seven-minute video, posted late Saturday, shows bearded militants using sledgehammers, jackhammers and saws to take down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. A bulldozer brings down walls, while militants fill barrels with explosives and later destroy three separate areas of the site in massive explosions.'God has honored us in the Islamic State to remove all of these idols and statutes worshipped instead of Allah in the past days,' one militant says in the video. Another militant vows that 'whenever we seize a piece of land, we will remove signs of idolatry and spread monotheism.'  Attack: The video, made available by a Jihadist media outlet, shows ISIS militants destroying a stoneslab with a sledgehammer at what they say is the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern IraqHorrified: The attack on the ancient site has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moonIslamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, daying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic lawIt is believed parts of the footage may be from a nearby site as some of the figures in the Nimrud video appears to have rebar, ribbed steel bars designed to reinforce concrete that are a technique of modern building.However, an Iraqi Antiquities Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all the items at Nimrud were authentic. When the destruction was first reported several weeks ago a Mosul tribal leader confirmed that SIIS had 'looted the valuables in Nimrud and then proceeded to level the site to the ground. There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely.''In a new crime in their series of reckless offenses they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC,' the United Nations cultural agency UNESCO said in a statement last month.UNESCO head Irina Bokova added: 'This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing under way in the country: it targets human lives, minorities, and is marked by the systematic destruction of humanity's ancient heritage,' she said  Complete destruction: The end of the video allegedly shows Islamic State militants blowing up the ancient ruins near MosulOne of many: This is only the most recent video purporting to show Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sitesIslamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, saying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law, including the ancient Iraqi city of Hatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Authorities also believe they've sold others on the black market to fund their atrocities.This is only the most recent proof of Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites.A shocking video emerged last week, showing ISIS militants using sledgehammers and AK-47 rifles to destroy walls and statues in Iraq's UNESCO World Heritage city of Hatra.In the slickly produced seven minute footage, jihadists are shown smashing shrines and statues in the 2,000-year old city.Militants are also recorded chipping away at the bases of some of the larger wall sculptures and cracking boulders into ancient city pillars, while eerie music plays in the background.The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'.Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. The Assyrians first rose around 2,500 B.C. and at one point ruled over a realm stretching from the Mediterranean coast to what is present-day Iran.They left dozens of palaces and temples decorated with huge reliefs mainly depicting their kings' military campaigns and conquests, hunting lions and making sacrifices to the gods. Their main hallmark was the colossal winged man-headed lions or bulls, protective deities put at the entrances of palaces and temples weighing about 10-30 tons each, some of which are now at the British Museum. Located on the eastern side of the Tigris River, Nimrud was founded in the 13th century B.C. During the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud served as the second capital for Assyrian Empire. Other Assyrian capitals were Ashur, Dur Sharrukin and Ninevah.Nimrud and some of its kings were mentioned in the Bible, the city mentioned under the name of Calah or Kalhu in the Book of Genesis. Excavations at Nimrud were first started by the British traveler and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard from 1845 to 1851, followed by other foreign and local excavation missions.The city is surrounded by a four-side wall measuring 8 kilometers (5 miles) long. Among the ruins are the grand palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as the temples of Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and other temples.Among the most significant discoveries at Nimrud were four tombs of royal women. There, a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones were unearthed. They survived the looting of the Iraqi National Museum that followed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 as they were kept in a vault at the Central Bank of Iraq building by Saddam Hussein's government.", "ref": " ISIS fighters destroyed ancient ruins of Iraqi Assyrian city of Nimrud dating back to the 13th century B.C.

Also in the snap is Jill, who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken.'Congrats @JessaSeewald @BenSeewald on your pregnancy!

Josh works for the Family Research Council, a pro life, anti gay marriage Christian lobbying organization in Washington DC. The whole family is famously prolife and shuns birth control. Michelle stopped taking birth control after she miscarried early in her marriage. She had gone on the pill following eldest child Josh's birth. Then she miscarried while taking birth control, she has said. Michelle then went off birth control and soon welcomed fraternal twins - and never used birth control again.Now Michelle and all her children proclaim that God does their family planning and they share their prolife beliefs on social media and the show.And lots of kids isn't all he shares with his parents. He and Anna also seems to be continuing a tradition with naming, as all 19 Duggar children have names that start with J, and his three children all have M names. Josh shared this photo of his pregnant wife and three children at the airport a few days ago. His eldest child is older than his youngest sisterThe whole family is outspokenly pro-life, and josh and Anna are seen here kneeling when attending a rally earlier this year.

It's getting better, but I'm still hanging on to the heartburn. And I don't have any super serious food cravings.'The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting.Ben was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share the good news that they're planning for a little one.The picture, in which the newlyweds are smiling and making the shape of a heart with their hands on Jessa's stomach, sparked rumors online of an impending pregnancy.Anna, left, got to be pregnant with Jill, right, for this her fourth pregnancy.

Previously Josh and Anna lived their, and welcomed their two older children into the world in home births in the house. Mackynzie was born int he master bedroom, and Michael was born while Anna was on the toilet.Marcus was born at a midwifery center.

UNITED NOW ON COURSE FOR CHAMPIONS LEAGUEFor much of the season United seemed to be in false position, with their performances hardly giving the impression they belonged in the top four.

Their run of four league wins in 12 games - during a period in which they also went out of two cup competitions - surely constitutes a crisis for a club with their expectations.

That has all changed in the last few months as he has become increasingly important to Van Gaal.

Adamant they would not pay it, the O'Byrne's exchanged a number of letters with the council over the next two years - with the row escalating from an initial \u00a325 fine to bailiffs knocking on their door and demanding \u00a3400.Mr O'Byrne, from Southsea in Portsmouth, Hampshire, was forced to pay the sum to Chichester District Council after the incident in a car park in Chichester, West Sussex.Mr O'Byrne, a self-employed marketing consultant, said: 'We parked in a marked bay and purchased a ticket.'As this was the first time we'd taken our first child out of the house it was all a bit of an ordeal getting her and the buggy out, out of the way of other traffic.'In my haste I failed to attach the ticket firmly to the inside of the windscreen.'On our return to the car I found a parking ticket on the windscreen and found my ticket on the floor just under the driver's seat.Not backing down: Chichester Council have insisted they followed the correct procedures and made the 'appropriate decision'  'As this was an unfortunate occurrence I assumed it would be cleared up by us sending a letter and the actual ticket to Chichester council explaining what had happened, which I did.'I was therefore a little shocked to hear that the council were not interested in my story.'The council didn't cancel the fine and both parties involved corresponded a number of times over the coming months.The family moved house to another address in Southsea over the two-year period and said he informed the council of his move.But bailiffs turned up at his old house, where Mr O'Byrne has tenants, and demanded payment or to take belongings to the value of \u00a3400.Mr O'Byrne believes the whole row has been a waste of time and money for the council, he said: 'I understand there is a process but common sense should have prevailed.'It was a \u00a32.20 ticket that I actually bought.

That's what people do. And that should truly frighten us.'FBI director James Comey, pictured at a news conference last month,  has caused huge offense to a U.S. ally by using language to suggest that Poles were accomplices in the HolocaustComey's comments are particularly offensive to Poles not only because they had no role in running Auschwitz and other death camps where Jews were murdered during World War II, but because they were themselves victims of the Third Reich.In all, 6 million Polish citizens were killed during the war, about half of them Jewish and the other half Christians, with many Polish priests, members of the intelligentsia and political resistance killed in Auschwitz and elsewhere.Poland also had a committed anti-Nazi resistance movement and Polish fighters fought alongside the Allies throughout the war.Poles see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized, making comments like Comey's hurt even more.Comey originally delivered the remarks on Wednesday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in arguing for the importance of Holocaust education.The speech was adapted for an article published in The Washington Post on Thursday.U.S. Ambassador Stephen Mull attends ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in front of the monument to the Heroes of the Ghetto, in Warsaw, Poland, on Sunday, April 19, 2015The Polish reaction was swift.On Sunday, the U.S. ambassador to Poland, Stephen Mull, was called to the Foreign Ministry in a formal act of protest on the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.Mull, a well-liked figure in Poland, went into damage-control mode.'Saying that Poland and any other country other than Nazi Germany were responsible for the Holocaust is a mistake, is harmful and is offensive,' Mull said.'Director Comey certainly did not mean to suggest that Poland was in any way responsible for those crimes.'In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf later echoed that sentiment, saying that 'Poles certainly bore a huge brunt of the barbarism of Nazi Germany.''Director Comey certainly did not intend to suggest otherwise, did not intend to suggest that Poland was in some way responsible for the Holocaust,' she said.The FBI had no immediate comment on the matter.Polish leaders all had something to say about the controversy.'To those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of World War II,' Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said on Sunday.'I would expect full historical knowledge from officials who speak on the matter.'Not all Poles behaved heroically during the war. Anti-Semitism was deep in the 1930s and some Poles pointed Jews out to the Nazis, who often could not tell Jew from non-Jew. There were also some cases of Poles murdering Jews during the war.But collaborating was never the official state position, as it was with Vichy France, for instance.In fact, during the war, the Polish underground army had a program to save Jews, called Zegota. And Poles caught denouncing Jews to the Nazis were even killed by the Polish resistance.President Barack Obama caused a similar controversy in 2012 when he used the wording 'Polish death camp.' Poles feel that that wording implies Polish complicity, and Obama later expressed 'regret' for the gaffe.'In referring to 'a Polish death camp' rather than 'a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland,' I inadvertently used a phrase that has caused many Poles anguish over the years and that Poland has rightly campaigned to eliminate from public discourse around the world,' Obama wrote at the time. 'I regret the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations know the truth.' The entrance to the Auschwitz death camp in Oswiecim, Poland.

The result leaves Neil Harris's side four points adrift of fourth-bottom Rotherham with two tough games remaining against promotion-chasing Derby and Wolves. Rotherham have a game in hand and a much better goal difference.Rudy Gestede (centre) scores the opening goal for Blackburn as he fires past the helpless David FordeGoals certainly make a difference and, in Rudy Gestede and Jordan Rhodes, Blackburn have two players that Millwall simply do not.Gestede, scorer of a hat-trick against Nottingham Forest here on Saturday, took his tally for the season to 20 in the 78th minute, despatching a clinical right-foot shot into the top corner after Craig Conway's cross found its way to him on the edge of the six-yard box.Rhodes is just behind on 19 goals after coming on as a substitute to make sure of victory, steering his shot past a stranded David Forde in the third minute of added time after the keeper had gone forward in the search for an equaliser.The big striker bagged goal number 20 for the season as he continues his excellent form for RoversBLACKBURN (4-4-2): Steele 7; Marshall 5.5, Spurr 6, Kilgallon 6.5 (Lenihan 37, 6.5), Olsson 6; Conway 8, Spearing 6, Evans 6.5, Taylor 6 (Cairney 71, 7); Brown 6 (Rhodes 71, 7), Gestede 6.5.

'It's clear to see why they won 2-0.'The team were excellent but we didn't take our chances. Before tonight we had to win two games to stay in the division. We need six or seven points so my thoughts still haven't changed.'Millwall's best chance fell to substitute Paris Cowan-Hall in the 68th minute. He was clean through on goal after Blackburn were caught out by Alan Dunne's long ball forward, but goalkeeper Jason Steele rushed off his line to block.Rovers, who lost captain Matt Kilgallon to injury in the first half and had to play debutant Darragh Lenihan in central defence, had their fair share of chances, but it needed a touch of class to make the difference.

Some look like exotic bird feathers and colourful ribbon, while others resemble jagged autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges. Scroll down for video  These stunning pictures show the finer details of a butterfly's wing in stunning clarity, including their rainbow scales. As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset mothThe photos were shot by Linden Gledhill from Staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a PhD in biochemistry.The 51-year-old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale-covered wings.Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their Greek order name of Lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings.Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtailThe tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the Eastern tiger swallowtail (stock image). It is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern North America and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern US, where it is common in many different habitatsEach scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence (pictured) are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments. A Papilio blumei fruhstorferi wing is shownThe brighter colours on some butterflies are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, such as these jagged examples, which are Papilio ulysees butterfly scales. In fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly speciesThe brighter colours are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, which are layered in different patterns on top of each other.In fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species.Some butterflies even reflect ultraviolet light, which is unable to be seen by humans. The ability of Monarch butterflies to detect ultraviolet light helps them on their annual migration from North America to Mexico, for example.Mr Gledhill said: 'I've always taken macro photographs of insects, moths and butterflies. I have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see.'This led me to use research quality microscopes and combining the two skills.'He uses a trinocular-reflecting light microscope fitted with Neo S-plan objectives, or attachments, and takes the photographs using a Canon EOS 5D mark II, which is fitted to the top of the microscope.The microscope has also been modified by adding a StackShot stepping motor and controller to drive the focusing control, meaning very small steps can be made in the focusing stage.Mr Gledhill said: 'I've always taken macro photographs of insects, moths and butterflies. I have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see.' This close-up image shows scales on the wings of the monarch butterflyMr Gledhill imaged the Madagascan sunset moth's wings in minute detail. The moth (pictured left) flies during the day and is considered one of the most impressive and appealing-looking lepidopterans. He also captured the wings of the monarch butterfly (stock image shown right), which is the most familiar North American butterfly speciesHe uses a trinocular-reflecting light microscope fitted with Neo S-plan objectives, or attachments, and takes the photographs using a Canon EOS 5D mark II. This camera is fitted to the top of the microscope. Overlapping pale blue scales are picturedThe depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures.These images are then combined into a single imaging using focus stacking software, resulting in pictures that are sharp and in full focus.'The pictures are stunningly beautiful and they make me realise how lucky I am to be able to capture the intricate structure of butterflies,' Mr Gledhill continued.'Often people think they are fabric and appear very surprised when they find out they are the scales which look like dust which they remember experiencing when they touched a butterfly as a child.' The depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures, before carefully combining the shots.

He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigationWeinstein, who has produced several Oscar-winning films, such as Shakespeare in Love, Pulp Fiction and The King's Speech, is said to have met Battilana on Thursday last week at the opening of a show at Radio City Music Hall.The next day he invited her for a business meeting at his Tribeca Film Festival office on Friday night.She claimed the 63-year-old Hollywood producer asked her if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed.Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she exited the building half an hour after arriving, it has been reported.Mr Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, but a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed.'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper.It is not clear if he was aware he was being monitored, but following the call and the meeting, he voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday.He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe.Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared.'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said.A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'.Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with himThe day after submitting her police report, the Italian model attended a Saturday matinee of the Weinstein-produced Broadway play 'Finding Neverland' and ever tweeted a photo of her $277, sixth-row orchestra seatUnder surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reportsWeinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a suspect past.It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010.She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party.It was also revealed she told Italian police in 2010 she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage.Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports.In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said.Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'.She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.'Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children togetherThe relationship ended when she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant.Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out.In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims.After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York.She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie.Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million.He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa.The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter.Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Weinstein to 'discuss business'", "ref": " Ambra Battilana, 22, did not 'co-operate' with authorities for four days .

But actually you can be wearing leather pants, and be zen,' Shannah told Daily Mail Australia.Thelma and Louise of Wellness: Shannah Kennedy (left) and Lyndall Mitchell (right) are taking their Masterclass of Wellness: The Boardroom Retreat to CEOs and executives across AustraliaBreathe deep: They teach skills and strategies which can be implemented into people's every day lives'You can be groovier, you don't have to be in your hessian pants because it's got to be relevant for corporates,' she added.The pair's workshop, aptly named the Masterclass Of Wellness: The Boardroom Retreat, is a way for executives and their staff to learn a set of skills that will help them every day.1. Create good habits that support you: Make sure you always have a 'reward' built in to the habit for example when you go for a run allow yourself to walk the final few blocks home, or grab a coffee.2. Reset throughout the day: As a stress reset try and take three deep breaths feeling your belly move rather than your chest. Do this as often as possible so you're building on an accumulative practice.3.Use your phone as a form of healthcare: Have your key values programmed into your phone to pop up each morning and let these guide your decisions.4. Set small sustainable habits: It's the small things you do that have the biggest impact. Look at something you already do and how can you make that into a habit. For example using your commuting time effectively by listening to an audiobook.5. Set technology boundaries: Switch off at least an hour before you go to bed at night, and don't check work emails until you're at your desk and able to deal with them.It takes attendees through a number of self-reflective activities, asking them to identify their key values and areas where they would like to improve.Four mediation sessions are spread throughout the workshops,which are filled with facts such as 80 per cent of thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent may be the same as the previous day. 'One in six staff members now suffer from a form of mental illness, whether it be stress, anxiety, depression or suicide,' Shannah revealed.'People don't go and have a day off because they have the flu, they actually need a mental health day.'Through their courses they work with executives and staff from organisations such as NAB, Macquarie Bank, PwC, kikki,K, Sportsgirl, Commonwealth Bank, Hewlett Packard and Mercedes Benz to help individuals and business be the most effective they can be.Asked whether there is any resistance to something that was once seen as 'hippie' or 'new age', the women said they have not experienced any, but instead have been overwhelmed by the amount of people taking it on board.'I've found in a lot of corporates that's shifting a little bit, because the consequence is too expensive for them' Shannah revealed. 'When their staff blow up and their staff do get depressed and are away the cost of replacing them is too much,' she added.Through their courses the pair teach different strategies and activities that can be implemented into daily life which stop staff 'burning out'.Decades of experience: Shannah (left) has been a life coach for 15 years, while Lyndall (right) started her career in a wellness retreatCrash and burn: Lyndall and Shannah help CEOs and executives avoid career burnouts and balance all elements of their lives'There's all these different trains of thought in our mind, which train are you on?' Lyndall, who started working at a health retreat 22 years ago, said. 'Knowing that we have a choice because 80 percent of our thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent can be the same as yesterday.'We have 60,000-80,000 thoughts a day so that's a lot of activity, so if you imagine you're standing at a train station, that's a lot of activity going on,' she continued.Practices such as meditation and even simple reminders of priorities are taught to help people stay on top of their game. Shannah knows only too well the toll a demanding career can have on one's health and wellbeing, and the implications of it crashing down around you.'I studied coaching after having chronic fatigue after a total burnout in the corporate world,' she revealed. '(I) Studied coaching, coached athletes into retirement and then turned corporate, so I now coach CEOs, state managers, business owners and have done so for a long time, Shannah added.Creating good habits: The pair share a number of key tips which help staff take control of their lives and be the best version of themselvesThelma and Louise: Shannah and Lyndall liken themselves to the duo from the 1991 filmWhereas Lyndall's background is 'looking after type A achievers like Shannah'.'I grew up in a remote part of Queensland and ended up working at Camp Eden health retreat, which was two doors away from my family home.'That cemented my passion for wellness so helping people overcome self-destructive behaviours, so alcohol addiction, drug addiction.'But then I decided retreat experiences are fantastic but how do you integrate this back into the real world?,' Lyndall said.It was around this time that the women met in a park while out with their kids, and decided to combine their knowledge to make it accessible for a wider audience. Busy lives: As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall (left) runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah (right) life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, but say they 'don't do stress'As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, and executives such as the director of PwC, Cade Brow.'We've got the busiest lives you've ever seen, but we don't do stress,' Shannah said.'It's just having the right skill set to support yourself'.Some of the women's other high profile clients include former Olympian Benita Willis, Founder and Creative Director of kikki.K Kristina Karlsson, and media personality Deborah Hutton. They also work with executives at Macquarie Bank and NAB - who they are about to embark on a national tour with, working with staff across all levels over the coming weeks.

The man, wearing an orange high-vis jacket, could be seen leaning out the sliding door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the M40 near Oxford.He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle.Today his boss, who has called the man in for a disciplinary hearing, revealed that the man claims he was only leaning out of the door because he wasn't feeling unwell and needed some fresh air.These shocking pictures show a workman hanging out of the door of a van as it speeds down the M40The man can be seen leaning out the side door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the outside lane of the motorwayThe incident, which police are investigating, is believed to have gone on for five minutes as the man pulled off the 'stunt' just yards from lorries.Dave Roy, a director at KJ Rail, said the man, the driver and their colleagues in the van would be hauled before a disciplinary hearing tomorrow morning. 'We're taking a robust approach to this and all of them will be in for a full disciplinary meeting first thing tomorrow,' he said.'He's told me he was leaning out the door for some fresh air because he was feeling unwell and the next services were miles away. Having seen the pictures I'm not so sure.'KJ Rail does not condone this sort of behaviour and takes a firm stance against it.'Mr Roy said the man could face the sack for the incident, which was captured by dentist James Hobkirk as he made his way down the M40, travelling south from Manchester to Kent.'My wife was driving and she spotted something strange in the rear view mirror,' Mr Hobkirk, 37, said. He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicleThe incident, which police are investigating, went on for five minutes, as the man pulled off the 'stunt' just yards from lorries'I turned around and there was this guy in the outside lane hanging out of the van, saluting people as he went past.'We were travelling about 65 in the middle lane and he came flying up behind us. He must have been doing about 80, 85.'He was just hanging out the side door for about five minutes. He's obviously a complete nut job.'People were moving in to the middle lane to get out of the way. It's like he was surfing.'There were about four people in the back of the van and two in the front. They were all laughing.'It's not just dangerous, he was an idiot. Going high speed in the outside lane and doing that is crazy.' KJ Rail, which owns the van, said it was investigating and that the man was likely to be punishedThames Valley Police are also investigating the incident, which took place on Friday afternoon.A spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police received a report of a man hanging out of a side door of a vehicle while travelling on the M40 motorway between junctions 9 and 8a southbound on Friday at 1.15pm.'Officers attended the scene and carried out an area search however the vehicle was not located. Enquiries are ongoing to trace the occupants of the vehicle.'Philip Goose, senior community engagement officer at Brake, the road safety charity, said: 'Driving is the most dangerous thing we do on a daily basis.'It is worth remembering that five people die every day on roads in the UK, and being in charge of a heavy, fast moving object has the potential to, and regularly does, kill and seriously injure individuals and tears apart families.'Driving deserves our full attention, and irresponsible behaviour such as this and driving at excessive speed greatly increases the chance of being involved in a fatal or life-changing crash.'", "ref": " Man seen leaning out of sliding door of work van in middle of motorway .

Be responsible when shooting and clean up the area you were shooting in so others can enjoy the land.' Referencing the charges against him, Bilzerian says: 'When shooting exploding rifle targets check with local and state law laws.'Just because you can buy an exploding target, does not mean that it is legal to mix and explode.'If shooting exploding targets use only in intended use containers.'The tape then cuts away to footage, believed to be of Bilzerian, shooting a target which promptly explodes into a plume of flame.He adds: 'As this is not intend use.'Bilzerian published this photo after he was released from custody following his arrest last year with the caption 'jail... let's not do that again', a phrase he is forced to repeat in the filmArsenal: Trust-fund child and professional gambler Bilzerian amassed 7.4million Instagram followers by posting a constant stream of images featuring guns, young women, and wild partiesBilzerian goes on to warn viewers that they can kill themselves or others when shooting exploding targets, before urging people to 'be responsible'.He then ends the film by saying 'jail... let's not do that again', the same phrase he sent to his followers after he was initially released from custody, along with a picture of himself on his private jet with two young women. Bilzerian has a following of 7million people on Instagram where he has become known for posting images of scantily clad women, wild parties, and his extension gun collection.His outlandish lifestyle has led to legions of fans and critics following his every move, which is all funded by his vast inherited wealth.And it was that following the Bureau of Land Management decided to tap into when they agreed not to jail Bilzerian following his arrest last year.Instead of locking him away, they gave him a rather nominal $10,000 fine, but also strong-armed him into making the film, which has since been widely viewed.Lethal force: Bilzerian once served in the Navy and took part in SEAL training, but was dismissed two days before passing after being disrespectful to an officerHeavy artillery: Bilzerain has used his socail media following to turn himself into a celebrity by bragging about his lifestyle, including firing this 20mm cannonExplosive temperament: On Thanksgiving Day, Blizerian shared this video of him blowing targets to smithereens with a large-caliber gunThis is not the first time Bilzerian's crazy antics have got him into trouble with the law. At the end of last year he found himself on the end of a lawsuit after model Vanessa Castano claimed he kicked her in the face in a nightclub.Footage from the scene appears to show Bilzerian dancing on a stage in a club in South Beach, Miami, with the crowd below him, before he lashes out with his foot.However, last month police said they were no longer investigating the model's claims.Bilzerian has been in trouble with the law before after  pornstar Janice Griffith, 19, attempted to sue him for $85,000 when he threw her off his roof and into a pool, breaking her footModel Vanessa Castano (pictured) also threatened to take Bilzerian to court after alleging than he kicked her in the face while dancing in a club in South Beach, MiamiHe was also facing a lawsuit for $85,000 in lost earnings after he threw pornstar Janice Griffith, 19, off the roof of his home and into the pool below.However she landed short, breaking her foot. She had tried to claim money for shoots she could not attend following the accident.Bilzerian fought back, claiming the model grabbed at his t-shirt at the last second, nearly dragging him off the roof with her. The charges were eventually dropped.Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100 million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler after developing his skills as a student at the University of South Florida.Bilzerian's life usually consists of partying with young, attractive women and firing high-calibre weapons - so it is no surprise he was less than enthused about the safety videoBilzerian is reportedly worth $100million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gamblerHe has won multiple tournaments, his most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker. He is also co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker.Before gambling, he served with the Navy before eventually getting kicked out of SEAL training two days before graduating for offending an officer.

Apple Inc has approached more than a dozen musicians, including Taylor Swift and British band Florence and the Machine in an effort to sign exclusive deals for some of their music to be streamed on BeatsApple declined to comment.Beats Music will be re-launched in coming months. There will be a $9.99-a-month subscription for individuals and a family plan for $14.99, according to sources, Bloomberg said.Apple bought audio equipment and music streaming company Beats for about $3 billion in May 2014, hoping to catch up in fast-growing music streaming industry. Music streaming service Tidal, launched last month by rapper Jay Z, is also trying to convince artists to sign exclusive deals for their content, to fend off competition from services such as Spotify and Google Inc's YouTube.Competitors: The Jay Z-backed Beats competitor Tidal has a slew of big name co-owners including Madonna, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna. Here, Beyonce and Madonna attend the Tidal launch in New York March 30Tidal isn't new, but it's getting a reboot from rapper Jay-Z, who bought the Scandinavian company behind it, Aspiro. Madonna, Rihanna and Beyonce are among the co-owners. That's notable because many artists complain about how little payment they get from other music services, such as Spotify. As owners, artists could insist on better deals.The membership-based service  will provide music and video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline.It is being offered at two price points: $10 for standard sound quality and $20 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' SPOTIFYOne of the most popular music services, with 60 million active users worldwide, and a quarter of them paying subscribers. Just this week, Spotify launched an app on Sony's PlayStation game console. The two companies worked closely to make listening seamless, so music can be heard in the background while playing games, without losing the game's sound effects, for instance. Spotify offers unlimited listening and Internet radio. It's free with ads; on mobile devices, users are limited to Internet radio and can't choose songs. Paying $10 a month gets you an ad-free premium service that offers song selection and offline playback on mobile devices. PANDORAOffers Internet radio only. More than 81 million active listeners. Free with ads, or pay $5 a month for an ad-free premium service and higher-quality audio over Web browsers.TIDALUnlimited listening. Among the few services offering high-fidelity songs, which many audiophiles prefer over MP3s and other formats that reduce quality in the compression process. Offers music video and curated playlists from experts. $10 a month for standard sound quality and $20 for high fidelity. There's no free offering. APPLEPay per song to download and own forever through iTunes. Free Internet radio through iTunes Radio on Apple devices. Also owns Beats Music, which offers unlimited listening for $10 a month, with no free version. Beats touts its playlists and other recommendations curated by experts, not computers.GOOGLEPay per song through Google Play. Google Play Music service offers unlimited listening for $10 a month, with no free option. Google also offers YouTube Music Key for selected music videos, free of ads, for $10. Paying for one gets you the other, too.AMAZONPay-per-song offering. Amazon's $99-a-year Prime membership comes with unlimited listening, though the song selection isn't as broad as what rivals offer.SAMSUNG'S MILK MUSICOffers free Internet radio like Pandora and others, but tries to make it easier to find music to match your mood.

{"i": "5e72a4afee3e580dd1164e651b1bb01ee679f627", "src": "A gel made from patients' own blood could help heal burns more quickly - and stop wounds getting worse.The gel contains platelet-rich plasma (PRP) - a concentrated mix of substances in the blood that play a role in healing. It is made by taking a small amount of blood from a patient's arm (amounts vary depending on wound size, but typically no more than a couple of tablespoons) and then processing it in a machine that spins the blood at high speed until it separates into its various components.Blood is largely made up of a clear yellowish liquid, called plasma, but it also contains small, solid compounds - red cells, white cells and platelets. The platelets are important for clotting, but they also contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important for healing.U.S. researchers are testing the new gel it as a dressing for burns Spinning the blood leaves behind the plasma and the platelets but in higher concentration - up to ten times greater than usual.Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and is also used in some cosmetic procedures that claim injecting it into the face can rejuvenate skin - nicknamed the 'vampire facelift'.U.S. researchers are testing it as a dressing for burns. As well as boosting healing, it is thought the gel, known as Magellan Bio-Bandage, will act as a barrier against infection.The researchers also hope using platelet-rich plasma will address a common problem with burns, which is that they often continue to get worse hours or even days after the original injury.This can mean a burn that had initially caused damage to the outer layer of skin (the epidermis) and the underlying tissue containing the hair follicles and sweat glands and smaller blood vessels (dermis) can become a 'full-thickness' burn.Platelet-rich plasma is sometimes used to treat tendon injuries and for cosmetic proceduresThis is where there is damage to the third and final layer of skin - the subcutis, which contains larger blood vessels and nerves, and regulates the temperature of the skin and body. Full-thickness burns usually require extensive treatment, including skin grafts.It's hoped the platelet-rich plasma will allow the wound to start to heal before it can deteriorate.The U.S. trial uses a new blood-spinning machine that is designed to be used at a patient's bedside, collecting it in a syringe ready for immediate use as a gel. Previous research suggests that the high concentration of growth factors in the platelet-rich plasma helps stimulate growth of new blood vessels and skin tissue. It's also suggested that it reduces pain, though it's not clear why.For the latest study, at the University of Utah and other burns centres, about 40 patients will have up to 18ml of the platelet-rich plasma (about three teaspoons) applied on to a partial-thickness burn within 72 hours of the initial injury. The quantities used may vary depending on the size of the injury.Commenting on the treatment, Dr Bav Shergill, consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, said: 'This is emerging technology that is causing a great deal of excitement. Platelet-rich plasma is already being used by orthopaedic surgeons with some amazing successes.'We are all looking for a method to collect and purify a high concentration of these effective molecules to improve repair in skin disorders. I look forward to large-scale trials of PRP showing similar results.'Meanwhile, a combination of platelet-rich plasma and stem cells is being tested as a treatment for knee arthritis.

'There were some nice goals, although we were sloppy at times.'For a little period in the second-half of 20 minutes, we went through the motions and we can't afford to do that.'It was pleasing in a few senses with some nice goals, some decent football and a clean sheet.'But we certainly know that Wednesday night will be a different challenge. I was at the Alloa versus Dumbarton game on Saturday and you could sense that Alloa had everything to play for and Dumbarton nothing bar pride, obviously.'I thought the game today might pan out as it did, but Wednesday will be different with Livingston flying in terms of their recent results.'There is no singing and dancing today. We have done OK. I still think that we'll need to be better and we can be better,' said McCall.Stuart McCall has warned Rangers to be on their guard against Livingston in midweekThe pick of the Rangers goals again came from Vuckic, who has scored in each of his last five Ibrox appearances. The Newcastle United loanee has netted seven times in 12 Rangers outings overall.'We tried to swap it around by playing a diamond and by getting Haris into more space,' added McCall, who expects another of the loanees, Shane Ferguson, to begin training with Rangers today.'But he still tends to head for the right-hand side, which is his favourite.'Every time he cuts in onto his left, you expect the net to bulge.'We had good footballers in there with him, Nicky Law, Dean Shiels and Andrew Murdoch, who I thought was terrific again.'I said from day one that Haris has got fantastic ability.'Obviously, he has got fitter having played more games now, and his match fitness is now looking strong at the end of games where he was flagging after 50 or 60 minutes earlier.'That's just having more time on the park. He is important to us and he is a goal threat.'Nicky Clark (left) heads it home to give Rangers an early leadRaith Rovers manager Grant Murray feels Rangers have improved under McCall, but he also believes that whichever Championship side comes through the play-offs will face a difficult task to clear the final promotion hurdle.'They still have to go and play a Premier League team and there is a good chance that that team will have a winning mentality,' said Murray.'People are talking about Ross County or Motherwell - well it won't be an easy task going to these kind of places.'I think everyone is talking about how Rangers have picked up now and they look like a strong team who will finish second.'Hibs have had a fantastic season, too, in terms of the attacking football they play, but I think Queen of the South are also keeping themselves in there.'We knew Rangers would come at us after losing on Thursday and we knew it would be difficult. It is difficult coming to places like this and you have to stand up and have the right mentality.

{"i": "24dc8a8e4eb8ba497b87b4827c3b9dc6b932a64c", "src": "Every week in the heart of Nima, a slum in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, families congregate at a local mosque. When the time comes, young girls say goodbye to their loved ones and part ways, filing up concrete steps leading up to the floor above.There, inside a large room dotted with brown tables, rows of flashing computer screens await for them.\"When the parents are praying [downstairs], we are teaching the girls upstairs,\" explains tech entrepreneur Regina Agyare, who comes here every week to teach local teens how to code.Agyare's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project Achievers Ghana -- was in January 2014. This was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative \"Tech Needs Girls\" -- however, the students proved quite a draw.\"I fell in love with them, so I decided to set up a coding club and started having regular sessions,\" says Agyare, founder of software development company Soronko Solutions.More importantly, continues Agyare, it offered the opportunity to show \"the community the value of educating girls.\"A predominantly Muslim area in a largely Christian nation, Nima has one of the densest populations in Accra. Agyare says life is often challenging for many  local girls, with some growing up without ever leaving the community.\"Girls were being forced to marry early; [denied] their right to go to school. Most of their dreams and aspirations were limited to just what was around them.\"I was shocked... I thought we had progressed as a nation. I thought we had gone past that.\"This, in part, was why Agyare lent her support to Achievers Ghana.Set up by local Amadu Mohammad, the non-profit organization supports 250 girls between the age of six and 18, priming them for formal education through extracurricular classes in reading, math, poetry and information technology. Its goal is to break through social barriers and provide Nima with a generation of female role models, and so the group provides school funding to help the girls shape their own future.The project was bequeathed its classroom above the mosque it shares a building with, and Agyare says the two work closely together. Achievers Ghana met initial resistance from local conservatives, but when the mosque's chief imam Sheik Hussein Abdul Rahman championed Mohammad's vision, few maintained their reservations.Now, with parents paying a nominal fee towards the running of the organization, it is in everyone's interest that the girls succeed.Fourteen months after her first visit, Agyare's coding class is well established. She has set up a mentor scheme as part of \"Tech Needs Girls,\" recruiting and training women at university to act as role models for her younger students in Nima.In each class, around 50 girls are taught HTML and run a blog called \"Slum Voices\".\"I definitely feel [technology] has given them more of a voice,\" Agyare says. \"I feel like it's allowed them to express themselves and interact with others... for them, it's important to be heard.\"Some girls had never used a computer before the classes began, but Agyare's even-handed approach has brought all her students up to the same standard. Agyare insists that \"we don't leave anyone behind.\"To that end, a few young male faces have found their way into her classroom.This was an accidental revelation, according to Agyare.

Or was that the other bloke?'The pair also revealed today that they are selling off a dozen bikes from the classic motor cycle collections - raising more questions about the future of their employment.May is putting eight of his two-wheeled treasures under the hammer, while Hammond, is doing the same with four of his. The BBC say the website change is to reflect the fact that none of the presenters are currently in contractTogether the 12 bikes are estimated to be worth a guide price of \u00a366,000 and are being sold off by auctioneers Bonhams later this month.  The Top Gear duo's bikes are being sold off by auctioneers Bonhams at their Spring Stafford Sale later this month.May insisted the decision to sell the bikes came before the latest BBC Top Gear turmoil, saying: 'Just because I'm unemployed now doesn't mean I have to get rid of everything.'I was going to sell these bikes anyway. And those paintings, and my collection of Scalextric cars. Honest'. Hammond added: 'As a serious collector of motorcycles, it's important to review one's stable regularly, and the Bonhams Stafford sale is the ideal opportunity to move bikes on and possibly acquire new ones.Hammond and May also revealed they are selling off a dozen bikes from the classic motor cycle collectionsThe BBC confirmed they will fulfil the Top  Gear live gigs, but they will be stripped of the Corporation's branding'I also have a canoe, and some Wharfedale hi-fi speakers, if anyone's interested'. However the BBC has confirmed that Top Gear's live world tour will go ahead next month, with the three original presenters at the helm.They will do a series of gigs, which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide and made \u00a310million, but the show will be stripped entirely of all BBC branding.Clarkson was sacked from Top Gear on March 25 after it was found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second assault, leaving him with a split lip and needing hospital treatment.The BBC announced 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another' following the suspension.

I don't think we'll be able to get him up on stage but he'll be there.'Regarding Jason's departure, Gary added: 'I think we've gotten used to it. It was very strange to start with it but it's been over six months.'We're just so excited to hit the road. People come to a Take That show expecting an extravaganza and that's exactly what they're going to get.'However, before Gary can get back to the UK for tour rehearsals, he has the small matter of seeing his musical open on Broadway.And as he waited for the premiere to take place in New York on Wednesday, Gary admitted he was feeling equal parts nervous and excited.He said: 'It's felt like a little secret for so long and it felt like it was never ever going to happen.

He's doing brilliant on The Late Late Show and if he'd have us we'd definitely go on and perform some songs from the musical.'Speaking about Hollywood supremo Harvey, Gary admitted he was surprised by how much creative control Weinstein gave him and co-writer Eliot Kennedy.'He's someone that I'd heard about and I was really keen to meet him,' Gary told MailOnline.

'Diane, the director of Neverland, always calls me JM Gary and says she is going to get me up on stage.'I cannot act whatsoever, so I think I'm just going to stick to writing and singing.''He completely trusted our music': Gary revealed Hollywood mogul and Finding Neverland producer Harvey Weinstein has been extremely encouraging since bringing him on to write the music for the Broadway musicalBig night: On Wednesday Gary's Finding Neverland had its Broadway premiere That's what friends are for: It was the new Late Late Show host James Corden who first put Gary in touch with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein when he was looking for someone to write the score for his musicalMeanwhile, Gary admitted he is dismayed by Louis Walsh's recent declaration that his X Factor days could be numbered and said he hopes the veteran judge doesn't leave.Barlow exclusively told MailOnline: 'I really hope he doesn't leave. To me he's the life of that show. He brings the silliness to it and that's what everyone loves. He's a big part of it behind the scenes too.

You can lean on each other. I think it's always harder for the one who leaves.'For One Direction it's just a transitional period.

Tuition, sporting and curricula fees for Scot's College, one of Sydney's most prestigious schools, reportedly top $30,000 The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot's College to skip their year 12 exams and 'buy' their entry into the sandstone university.'Access to university should be fair and equitable,' Mr Piccoli told Fairfax Media. 'Any scheme that gives some students an unfair advantage is unacceptable and I will be discussing this with the federal government, which is responsible for universities.' Eight Scot's students gained 'direct entry' to the university after completing the program in 2014, according to a letter sent to parents by principal Dr Ian Lambert, while 166 students completed the HSC.   The program was devised by the university's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses, including bachelor degrees in health sciences, liberal arts and science, animal and veterinary bioscience, visual arts, music and oral health, or in a diploma of law. Opposition leader Luke Foley is concerned over how this alternative would impact the HSC.'We have a federal Coalition government intent on linking university admission to wealth, more and more, and these are the sorts of arrangements that flow from the Abbott government's reform of our higher education sector,' he said.The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that concern within the University of Sydney staff has led to its academic board shutting down this alternative pathway for school students.Sandstone halls: The University of Sydney's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, has run the pilot program with Scot's College. Pictured above is the university's clocktower and the eastern range of its main building precinctHowever, at the time it was shutdown, the board was unaware that Scot's College were planning the pilot with another 11 boys this year. My Foley is worried that this pathway will be picked up by other universities and elite high schools.Scot's College does not advertise their fees for tuition, sport and other curriculum activities, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 per year with an extra $24,121 for boarders. Scot's College: Dr Lambert, the college's chief, was quoted telling the Sydney Morning Herald that the diploma was designed with students 'in the middle rank of learners' in mindRose Steele, the president of the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia that while it was important there were alternative pathways available for students to gain entry to university, it was 'really concerning' if this program was only open to students who could afford it. 'NUS really believes education should be open to all and not just those who can afford it,' Ms Steele said. Daily Mail Australia approached the University of Sydney and Scot's College for comment on Monday morning. Principal Ian Lambert has rejected the notion that it was an exclusive deal for Scot's College.He agrees that the current HSC grading system works for the top 20 percent of students, but not for middle-ranking students.Do you know more?

You think it's going to be easy because we have said 'We are going to have good relations with you' and they say, 'That's not exciting for us and it is for you.' So they are hard negotiators as they always have been.\"The forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations.While President Barack Obama is not scheduled to meet Cuban leader Raul Castro, U.S. officials said there will be opportunities for \"interaction\" between the two leaders.The first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral. Their brief handshake captured the world's attention and lit up social media. Few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked Cold War-era relations.Obama had said he had hoped a U.S. Embassy would reopen in Havana before the summit, but Cuban officials have said they cannot imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until Cuba is removed from the U.S. State Department list of countries that support terrorism.\"It would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while Cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism,\" said Josefina Vidal, the general director of U.S. affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and lead negotiator in the talks.Cuba was added to the list in 1982, which includes Syria, Iran and Sudan. The designation carries financial sanctions which Cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy.The State Department has sent a recommendation to the White House that Cuba be removed, paving the way for the White House to announce its intent to de-list Cuba as early as this week, two administration officials told CNN.Removal from the list \"does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system, or its foreign policy,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \"It's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism.\"Rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on Venezuela, saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the United States, despite a recent declaration to that effect.The designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt Venezuelan officials, but it ignited a firestorm, particularly in Cuba, which has close ties to Venezuela.Deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was a friend and admirer of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez's successor Nicolas Maduro continues to send Cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day, despite his country's own economic turmoil.In exchange, Cuba sends doctors, military advisers and sports trainers to Venezuela.In Cuba's state-run media, criticism of U.S. policy towards Venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations.In March, Fidel Castro published a letter criticizing the U.S.' \"brutal plans towards\" Venezuela and the Cuban government promised \"unconditional aid\" to help defend against American threats.Its remains to be seen how much Cuba will risk its warming relations with the United States to back up ally Venezuela.But apparently there is little doubt among the Cuban people on what their government should do.A poll of 1,200 Cubans released on Wednesday found that 97% of the people surveyed by Miami-based polling firm Bendixen & Amandi on behalf of The Washington Post and Univision Noticias/Fusion supported improved U.S.-Cuban relations.", "ref": " Cuba pulled off a diplomatic coup by gaining attendance at Summit of the Americas.

Last night, it was not clear if he will be allowed to continue playing before his case is dealt with.Gerry Wareham, of the Crown Prosecution Service, announced the decision to charge Johnson.He said it was in the public interest to charge the footballer and there was a 'realistic prospect' of a conviction.Johnson was told of the charges he will face during a 20-minute meeting with detectives. Dressed in a navy tracksuit and white trainers, he emerged grim-faced and walked swiftly out of the police station without commenting before being driven away.He stands accused of three offences of sexual activity with a child, contrary to Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.The offences are said to have taken place between December 30 last year and February 26.He has also been charged with meeting a child following sexual grooming under Section 15 of the Act.Johnson was arrested on March 2 at his six-bedroom, \u00a31.9million home in Castle Eden, near Hartlepool. Court date: Premier League winger Johnson (centre) will appear at Peterlee Magistrates' Court on May 20Winger: Johnson (left, with long-time girlfriend Stacey Flounders, and right, in a match against Newcastle United on April 5) has made 31 appearances for Sunderland this season, scoring five goalsHe became a father for the first time on January 8 when his girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to their daughter Ayla Sofia.The alleged sexual activity offences cover a period while she was pregnant and after she gave birth.Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough's youth academy as a 12-year-old.He made his Premier League debut for the club in 2005 and was sold in 2010 to Manchester City. Sunderland signed him for \u00a310million in 2012.Initially the player was suspended after his arrest. But two weeks later, he was allowed back to training and returned to the team under Sunderland's new manager Dick Advocaat. Home: The Premier League winger was arrested at his mansion (pictured) in County Durham on March 2Former Middlesbrough star: Adam Johnson has represented England at senior level 12 timesAdam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17.Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal.He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club.On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a \u00a37million move to Manchester City in February 2010.In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield.In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a \u00a310million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham.He said after taking the match ball as a memento: 'These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on.'This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.'He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month.The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012.He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year.Derby win: Winger Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last DecemberSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.", "ref": " Four offences allegedly committed against one girl aged 15 at time. 27-year-old answered bail at police station in County Durham yesterday.

A coroner has called for the 'dangerous' cot to be pulled from the shelves after the newborn baby girl was strangledGrace's mother Esther put her down for a nap at around 8.30am on April 9. The cot \u2013 which is designed to be placed next to a parent's bed \u2013 has a moveable panel on one side which can be folded down, leaving a ridge just 7cm high.Mrs Roseman returned about 90 minutes later to find Grace unresponsive, lying with her head over the edge of the cot.The provisional cause of death was given as asphyxia, caused by the ridge cutting off the oxygen supply from Grace's windpipe.In her report, Mrs Schofield listed a number of concerns surrounding the cot. She said: 'In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths ... should another baby be placed in the prone position and left with the side incompletely lowered again in one of these cots, another death could occur. 'If the cot's side is not safe to be incompletely lowered or for the cot to be tilted more than 5cms then it should be questioned as to whether these should be options available at all.'Grace's father Gideon, who lives with his wife in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, said: 'There are no words that can describe how we feel about the loss of our beautiful little Gracie. Grace's parents told the inquest 'We are eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath (pictured), who did everything possible to try and save our little Gracie''She was just starting to develop her own little personality and was always smiling. We would not wish any parent to have to go through such a devastating loss.' The National Children's Trust has pulled the cot from sale and stopped all pending orders going out. Susie Parsons, interim chief executive of the charity, said: 'This is a tragedy and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the Roseman family at this time.'We have immediately suspended all sales and despatches of the Bednest crib until the completion of the inquiry and we will also undertake our own detailed and thorough review.'Bednest, which is based in Stratford-upon-Avon, is still selling the cribs on their website from \u00a3249. The page boasts an endorsement from Jools Oliver, the wife of celebrity chef Jamie. Mrs Oliver writes: 'We love the Bednest ... I love the way it is so close to our bed the sides are really easy to pull down.'Easy and definitely eliminates the fear of falling asleep with them in your bed and suffocating them as they lay safe next to you but in their own safe little cosy bed.'A spokesman for Bednest told MailOnline: 'We are greatly saddened and extend our heartfelt condolences to Grace's parents.'We are doubly upset to hear this news, since the concept behind Bednest's design is first and foremost about baby health and safety and came originally from highly experienced neo-natal nurses.'It is not the case that the coroner has called the cot \"dangerous\" and asked for it to be withdrawn.'The coroner has highlighted that all safety guidelines for the correct use of the crib are laid out in the instruction manual, but due to a growing second-hand market for our Bednest cribs, these instruction manuals may not be passed on. This may be, sadly, what happened with Grace's crib.'We are now considering displaying basic instructions on the side of the crib itself.'", "ref": " Seven-week-old Grace Roseman died in adjustable Bednest Bed Side crib.

The winner is whoever puts his opponent on the ground, whether on his back, rear, stomach, or a combination of hands and knees.

Star wrestlers become lords of entire districts, privileged with providing for their friends and rewarded with unflinching loyalty. Their hordes of fans become the equivalent of neighborhood gangs and brawls between rivals are common in and out of the stadium. Similarly to the 'weigh-in' in boxing, tensions are inflamed at the pre-match promotion where both the competitors and their fans square up to one another in front of television cameras. A recent 'face \u00e0 face' between Y\u00e9kini and Balla Gaye 2 descended into a brawl and riot police had to break up the scuffle.

On Saturday, at the 161st Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, the women's crews will battle the same Thames course as the men, who will follow an hour later.After decades of campaigning and 88 years since the first women to race were jeered by male spectators, they get equal billing. And for Wilson's grandfather, 85-year-old Richard Cowell, from East Kilbride, it will be a momentous day. He is not up to the journey to watch his granddaughter compete for Cambridge but will still see the race, which will be televised for the first time.Wilson, 21, said: 'I remember when I was 14 watching with my dad and my brother and saying \"Are there going to be women on?\" They laughed \u2014 not in a malicious way \u2014 and said: \"There aren't any women, you could cox I guess\". So the fact that 10 years on there is a women's race on the Tideway and I'm in it is pretty remarkable. It's so wonderful that my grandfather will be able to watch it, too.'Melissa Wilson (left) and Caroline Reid of Cambridge Women's boat crew at Thames Rowing Club in LondonClare Balding gave up her regular stint on Channel 4's Grand National coverage to present the event because she wants to send a message about the importance of women's sport. 'It was a big decision to make,' said Balding. 'But there will never be another first women's Boat Race on the Tideway.'Her statement was welcomed by Caroline Reid, the Cambridge president. 'It brings the attention of another audience, people who follow Clare,' said Reid, 24. 'Maybe people who support the Grand National disagree but they will at least be aware it's happening and that is a good thing.'Wilson, a third year English literature student and Reid, in her fifth year of veterinary medicine, rise at 5.30am each day for training, gym work and lectures, then it's back out on the river in the afternoon.Cambridge Women's Boat Crew including Wilson (front) rowing the ThamesReid, Claire Watkins and Wilson prepare ahead of the Boat Race next SaturdayUntil this year, the women's race was held a week before the men's at Henley. The course was 1.2 miles compared with this year's 4.22 mile battle from Putney to Mortlake.'At Henley it's straight, so conditions are largely the same the whole way down,' said Reid. 'Tideway conditions change because the river bends. There's a different mental and tactical side, which is exciting.'But Reid refuses to be seen as a pioneer. 'The first women's race was in 1927 and there were a lot of people against it, talking about whether women should be rowing at all and what they should be wearing, so they were the pioneers. We're just carrying on in their footsteps,' she said.", "ref": " After decades of campaign the women's crews are to make history.

I can't make any more progress if they don't do these operations.'  Mr Mason is now preparing to undergo an operation in the U.S. after plastic surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla, from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, offered to carry out the procedure free of charge. Speaking to The Mirror, she said: 'I remember seeing an image of him, wheelchair-bound, he couldn't walk.'To me it was so sad that he had gone through this whole journey and come full circle, and he couldn't even do basic things and no-one would help him.'Turned down by NHS: The 54-year-old wanted the surgery done for free but failed after health service bosses said he needed to prove that he could keep the weight offPreparing for more surgery: Mr Mason is now preparing to undergo an operation in the U.S. after plastic surgeon Dr Jennifer Capla, from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, offered to carry out the procedure for freeRoad to recovery: Mr Mason, seen walking in hospital in Massachusetts last month, moved to the USA last year to live with his fianceAfter an agonising period in which he had to wait for a health visa to be granted, the former world's fattest man flew to Orange, near Boston in September to live with his fiance, Rebecca Mountain.In 2013 Mr Mason appeared on television to tell the world of his blossoming relationship with Ms Mountain.41-year-old Miss Mountain, who is a slender 8st, asked for his hand in marriage as they appeared live on ABC's The View last year. She first got in touch with Mr Mason on Facebook after she saw a television documentary about his extreme obesity.Appearing on UK breakfast television programme in 2013, in the week they met in person for the first time, she said she 'just felt compelled to reach out and just try to help and that's all it was.''I have a lot of drive and just thought I could write letters and support,' she said. 'Things I set my sights on, I just go and do. I just knew that I should try and help.'He's incredible, a genuine person. Incredibly honest and open about the difficulties he's been through, which helped our relationship.'Former world's fattest man: At the height of his food addiction, he was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfastFound love: In 2013 Mr Mason appeared on television to tell the world of his blossoming relationship with Rebecca MountainMr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health.He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds. As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers.Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002.Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. His care bill cost taxpayers an estimated \u00a3100,000 a year and is believed to have topped \u00a31million.At the height of his food addiction, he was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast.He would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening.Mr Mason finally beat the bulge after an NHS operation to fit him with a gastric band, but his life was left on hold as he waited for further surgery to remove the excess skin it left behind.

Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did.'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at clitheroe.'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught.'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there.'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.'  His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters.The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip.Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart, 24,  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legsOne person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first.He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed.'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.'Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident.His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine.'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said.Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible.'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'.She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down.'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally.'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.'Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground.'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them.'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done.'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that.'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it.'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.'

'It is not convincing to argue, as her supporters do, that she is only free to make her views known now that she has stepped down as America's chief diplomat. Her successor at the State Department, John Kerry, and has not been stoned as a blasphemer on any of his stops around the world to date,' the magazine's US columnist wrote.

But for all the excitement Villa fans must be patient.Talking about getting a club 'back where they belong' can be a dangerous game. Villa won the European Cup in 1982 and while there's nothing wrong with being ambitious, fans have to be realistic.Previous generations at Villa have seen success and can be too demanding. Even when they were challenging for the Champions League under Martin O'Neill there were still rumblings of discontent.When things do start to go wrong, Villa Park can be an unforgiving place. I experienced that when I was relegated and it can be a difficult place to play. But what ground isn't when things are going badly?In the past Villa Park has been so loud players could hardly hear themselves think and the atmosphere the fans created at Wembley was magnificent. Now with Sherwood hopefully a generation can grow with his side.Making the final is a fine achievement and Sherwood and his players will be desperate to become part of the fabric of a fantastic club.Aston Villa celebrate winning the European Cup after beating Bayern Munich in Rotterdam 33 years agoManager Tim Sherwood has invigorated Aston Villa and has considerably improved the side's performances", "ref": " Aston Villa have a chance of FA Cup glory after reaching the final.

Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress as Katie Couric wrote: 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health.' Scroll down for video By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomyChristiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.'Actress Christina Applegate, who underwent a double mastectomy in 2008, also tweeted: 'Sweet beautiful powerful Rita!!! Loving you so much!'Singer Sara Bareilles wrote: 'Beautiful Brave Friend. Thinking of you and grateful for your courage.'While reality star Lisa Rinna wrote: 'Sending love + light to @RitaWilson thank you for Sharing your breast cancer story of getting a second opinion your courage will help many.''Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted.Best wishes: TV presenter Katie Couric, who is a spokeswoman for colon cancer awareness following the death of her first husband, John Monahan, was one of the first stars to react on social media Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcementIn her statement, Rita explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week.'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement.'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future familiesBrave: The star from the TV, film and music industries all praised her brave decisionTreatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosedThe mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend.The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said.'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she didWilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David.At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly.Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'.She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close.Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked.Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriageInvasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner.Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas.Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple.Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types.The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body.It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer.Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation.According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas.The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer.According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.", "ref": " Stars such as Katie Couric and Christina Applegate praised the 58-year-old actress for revealing her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday.

Prosecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuse.Walters, 51, denies the murder of his wife, who died in hospital two days after the high-speed crash. A jury of nine women and three men was told yesterday that Walters, of  Swindon, was returning home with his wife from a 'make-or-break' week away in North Yorkshire which ended in an argument.Giving evidence to the second day of Walters' trial, several witnesses described how passing motorists went to aid the couple, both trapped in the wreckage of the 4x4.The first witness, Robin Goss, told jurors the driver of the pick-up appeared to have made a 'conscious, deliberate' decision to steer towards the hard shoulder.Mr Goss, a 39-year-old training consultant from Buckinghamshire, told jurors he was up to 150 metres behind the L200, doing around 70mph in the inside lane.'Everything was normal,' Mr Goss told the court. 'Then all of a sudden I saw this car just swerve violently across to the left.'It completely disappeared and I remember looking into the hard shoulder. Then I saw what looked like a little explosion.'Bits of tree and bits of plastic came out in front of me. When I saw the dogs, I started to put together what had happened.'Child protection worker Gary Donald, who was driving a Kia Picanto on the southbound carriageway, also gave evidence to the court about the crash on March 21 last year.He told jurors he saw the pick-up veer sharply from right to left - performing 'almost a straight turn' - and move towards a line of trees.The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard 'The canopy of all the trees shook - I would use the word 'imploded' - and there was luggage, bits of car, and parts of tree flying into the air,' Mr Donald said.Under questioning from defence QC Christopher Millington, Mr Donald agreed that time-lapse CCTV footage of the L200 showed a 'rather less dramatic' veer than he had described to the court.Witness Steven Prince, a passenger in a Range Rover which stopped at the scene, told how he attempted to reassure Mrs Walters before she was cut free.Giving his recollection on the aftermath of the crash, Mr Prince told the jury panel he did not witness the moment of impact but had seen a cloud of dust.'I looked left and I saw two dogs out where they shouldn't be and I saw the car that was already in the tree.'After the crash, the metalwork of the vehicle had to be 'unpeeled' from around Mrs Walters by emergency crews, the court was told The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crashProsecutors allege that Walters, a driving test examiner, deliberately steered his Mitsubishi L200 off the motorway after his wife said she wanted a divorce and made allegations of domestic abuseAfter getting out of his mother's car, Mr Prince said, he ran along the hard shoulder towards the crashed vehicle.'The car was a hell of a mess,' Mr Prince added. 'I didn't bother looking at the driver's side because I thought whoever was in there was going to be squashed.'The court heard that the witness then made his way to the passenger side of the vehicle, where he saw a hand sticking out of the wreckage. He said: 'She said she was dying. I told her she would be alright and that I wasn't going anywhere, just to calm her down and make her feel at ease as much as I could.'Prosecutor Charles Miskin QC asked Mr Prince if Mrs Walters, who was aged 48, had said anything else.'No, other than that she couldn't breathe,' Mr Prince replied. 'She kept on telling me that and she kept on saying that she was dying.'The trial, which may last for up to a month, was adjourned until next week.

But a study has found that the opposite may be true. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick, and invested in employment schemes, the more likely its residents were to want a job.A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick the more likely its residents were to want a job. In Norway, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80% of people wanted a job. In Estonia, one of least generous, only around 40% didIn Norway in particular, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80 per cent of people wanted a job, By contrast in Estonia, one of the least generous countries, only around 40 per cent did.The survey was carried out by sociologists Dr Kjetil van der Wel and Dr Knut Halvorsen from Oslo and Akershus University College. They examined responses to the statement: 'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' put to the interviewees for the European Social Survey in 2010.People who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor.  The extraordinary results of a recent study from Aarhus University found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues.Researchers said people's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but 'rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves.'And they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance, with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology. These responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes, while taking into account the population differences between the member states. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits, which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent.The researchers also found that governments that intervene  to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they didn't need the money.'Many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion, disincentives to work and dependency cultures,' the researchers said in the paper, 'The bigger the worse? A comparative study of the welfare state and employment commitment'.'A basic assumption is that if individuals can obtain sufficient levels of well-being - economic, social and psychological - from living off public benefits, compared to being employed, they would prefer the former. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits and this was reflected in the percentage of people wanting to work - at 60% (stock image pictured). The study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they didn't need the money'When a 'critical mass' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work, the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken, setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the 'self-destruction' of the welfare state.  They also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work. 'The notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency, or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work, receives little support.'

We had been approaching people all afternoon, and suddenly we found someone who not only sings but is willing to bust out like that on the first try,' Matt told Daily Mail Australia.'They later sampled the velvet vocals of the jogger, which they described as 'actually amazing,' into an electronic dance song.'As DJ's we try to collaborate with as many people as we can, but it's not always easy to link up with Black Eyed Peas or David Guetta, so we decided to hit the streets.'  The DJ's said they were shocked to find such an impressive talent on the street, and that it proves there is talent to be found beyond  artists featured on TV and radioThe duo approach the likes of a busdriver and 7-Eleven clerk and invite them to collaborateLast month, the boys released a similar video which saw them order pizza and collaborate with the deliveryman. But the seemingly blas\u00e9 response of the DJs in their latest clip has fuelled accusations that the video was staged.'People are entitled to their opinion,' Matt said. 'We always get a wide range of responses to our videos, and that's fine. All we wanted to do was show you there is a talent everywhere, not just on the TV and radio,' said Matt.The band has since received a flurry of requests to release a full version of the song, which they plan to do at a later date.'We're pretty stoked at how much the video has taken off. It's very exciting. Hopefully we can do something for the singer too, it would be amazing if he got signed!' Last month, the boys released a similar video which saw them order Domino's pizza and collaborate with the deliverymanThe duo said they are 'stoked' with the success of the video and they hope it will help the singer they featured raise his profileThe jogger in the clip was later revealed as Ross Burbury (pictured,) a singer songwriter from BrisbaneThe singer in the video, later revealed as Ross Burbury, is a singer songwriter from Brisbane who is also head of direct sales at News Corporation.Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Burbury for comment but he was unavailable at the time of publication.

The officer then had the woman sit inside with the windows up and ignition off.And this isn't the first time an animal-loving officer has employed the unorthodox punishment.In the recent Ohio incident, the woman was left 'looking uncomfortable' as she sat in her unventilated Nissan Sentra, but drove away with just a warning and her tail between her legs.Scroll down for video Unorthodox: A cop ordered a woman in this Ohio shopping center to sit in her hot car this month after officers discovered her dog locked inside her Nissan Sentra as she shopped in WalmartIn Truth or Consequences, New Mexico last June, the pet owner in question wasn't as eager to put the incident behind her.Shelly Nicholas filed a report against an officer who told her to sit in her car after someone called to report a dog was inside with no ventilation in 90 degree heat. Nicholas reasoned that she'd only been away ten minutes. 'You can wait in the truck and close the door you know, since it's not that hot,' the officer is heard saying to Nicholas in body camera footage later obtained by KOB.However, in her report, Nicholas characterizes the officers words as an 'order' and the footage does not show her actually sitting in the hot car as police wrote her a ticket.Sweating it out: Last year, Shelly Nicholas in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico was told to sit in her hot car after her dog was found locked inside with no ventilation. She filed a report against the officers, but body cam footage later revealed it was more of a request than an orderDeclined to do it: Nicholas declined to sit in the the hot car with the door closed in spite of the officer's requestWhile this may not be a legitimate police practice, officers have reason for concern in these situations, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.While Nicholas argued she'd only been gone 10 minutes, the AVMA says that temperatures can rise 20F inside a car in that short amount of time.In 20 minutes, the temperature can rise by nearly 30 degrees.Even on a 70F day, writes the AVMA, the interior of a car can reach 110F after one hour.Even short periods in such heat can cause heat stroke and irreversible organ damage in your dog.h/t Huffington Post", "ref": " A woman at an Ohio Walmart says an officer forced her to sit in her car after she left her dog sitting in the parking lot April 12.

{"i": "3e57281183eb01e01fc23b3cdf13744b209b96e4", "src": "We are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight. Perhaps that's incorrect. The migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to Sicily has been brewing for years, but in the past 10 days, with as many as 1,600 deaths in the Mediterranean, suddenly minds are focused -- for now.Almost exactly four years ago, in Libya, I caught, perhaps, a glimpse of what was to come.It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata. Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war (back then some optimistically called it a \"revolution\") and the deep blue sea. They had come to Misrata from Ghana, Nigeria and elsewhere, hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe.They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces, but weren't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city. They appealed to us to help them escape.We could do nothing, but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided.The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which we reporters covered so avidly, was followed by chaos, which we in the news media largely neglected, focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe, the Syrian civil war. In that chaos, the business of human trafficking has boomed.And now that boom in human misery is coming in waves to the shores of Italy. The focus today is on those lost at sea. Aware of the tragedy underway, however, Italians are alarmed at the prospect that this year alone as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe, according to one European Union official.That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania, where many migrants arrive. The city's mayor, Enzo Bianco, insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants, but says Catania, and Sicily cannot absorb the ever-growing numbers. The rest of Europe must help carry the burden.\"If something serious isn't done,\" he warns, \"dramas like these will be repeated. This problem will not be resolved by hiding our heads in the sand.\"Increasingly, some Italians are losing their patience. Two northern regions, Veneto and Valle d'Aosta, have declared they will no longer accept new migrants. The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program.Others, however, insist Italy must keep its doors open. In Catania port, I spoke with Grazia Giurato, who had joined a small protest in solidarity with the migrants.\"Many years ago, our grandparents emigrated,\" she recalled. \"Let's keep that in mind.\"Indeed, in tougher times, millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia. They, too, like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East, were fleeing grinding poverty and war. And they, too, experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home.That's the long view, perhaps. But now, today, Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills, ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption, hopeless poverty, oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan, expensive and politically daunting effort.And while this crisis has been brewing for years, it is now truly upon us.", "ref": " Hundreds of desperate migrants have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean in recent says.

For workers aged 50 to 64, pay rises plunge to a meagre 1.2 per cent, official figures show \u2013 significantly below the UK average of 2.1 per cent.The Office for National Statistics revealed in its latest Economic Review that the under-25s are five times as likely to have moved jobs in the past three months than workers over-50.But while younger workers often receive greater pay rises because they move jobs more frequently, official data shows that the gap is widening.In 2009, Britain's youngest workers received pay rises three times greater than older workers, but this has now widened to nine times greater. In the last three months of 2014, 5.4 per cent of 18-25-year-olds changed jobs, compared to only 1.2 per cent of 50-64-year-oldsExperts said the growing gulf between the generations could signal a reluctance by employers to train and promote older members of staff. Ros Altmann, a Whitehall adviser on older workers, said: 'Younger people's pay is rising faster than average and the rate of increase is accelerating.'It could be because younger people are the most likely to receive training, with employers keen to focus on the newer workers and spending far less on training older workers.'With the pace of change in technology and processes being so rapid nowadays, the need for ongoing training is more important than ever, so people do not fall behind in terms of pay and productivity.'Labour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government, claiming the Tories 'believe in the old idea that as long as the rich and powerful are OK then everyone else will succeed'She also criticised the Government for subsidising training for under-25s, 'so that employers find it much cheaper to train youngsters than older workers'.She added: 'The increase in pay for younger workers is great news and shows they are progressing well. On the other hand, those who are in their later years seem less likely to be treated so generously and have not been able to enjoy the same kind of pay growth as younger colleagues.'Lisa Harris, at over-50s specialist firm Saga, said: 'Many older workers have spent years climbing the career ladder and are more likely to value the job satisfaction and security of doing the job they know well over the pursuit of more money.'However, it's important that employers properly value the contribution and commitment of older workers and ensure they are fairly paid for the job they do and are not taken advantage of.'", "ref": " Workers aged 18-25 saw wages rise eight times faster than over 50s.

While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied. Scroll down for video A racket? A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says.Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp.'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he's complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn't figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production. The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page.'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive.'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online.Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page.While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken.'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads.

The $40 (\u00a326) cloth cover - which comes with a lifetime guarantee - is said to hydrate the face and prevent lines while you sleep.And unlike a normal cotton pillowcase, which apparently sucks moisture from the skin, the  Wrinkle Preventing Pillowcase's special blend of 'hydrophobic fibres' keeps the complexion hydrated all night. The Wrinkle Preventing Pillowcase has 'a blend of hydrophobic fibres that help skin retain moisture'The infused special fibres are said to fight wrinkles like a face cream, redirecting moisture back into the skinThe pillowcase, made by  Hammacher Schlemmer, in Canada, was developed by a dermatologist and contains no creams or chemicals.According to its description online, a traditional cotton case has a 'rough surface' that 'siphons moisture' away, leaving the face dry and dull.But the wrinkle preventing version is 'therapeutic and extra-smooth', redirecting moisture back into the skin for a more vibrant, healthier-looking appearance in the morning. They say the machine washable silky pillowcase also helps skin stay smooth, thanks to its 22,000 densely woven micro-filaments that prevent friction and remain taut.They thwart the bunching and pressure that cause standard cases to inscribe sleep lines, 'which can develop into permanent wrinkles'.  Another creation from Hammacher Schlemmer, which also comes with a lifetime guarantee, is the Anti-Wrinkle Beauty Pillow.The \u00a340 Anti-Wrinkle Beauty Pillow is said to banish face and chest wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their sideIt is said to banish facial and chest sleep wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their side. Contoured like a butterfly with strategically placed cut-outs on either side and a supportive front wing, the soft, lightweight pillow's polyurethane foam gently elevates the face and chest, preventing contact with the bed or pillow below. This apparently helps remove pressure on facial muscles which, as The American Academy of Dermatology cautions, can result in pillow wrinkles, creases, and puffiness. The lower wings elevate and support the head, shoulders and arms allowing for a comfortable back sleeping position in a way that can't be achieved on a conventional pillow. Use alone or as a pillow topper with an existing pillow.

She admitted that it has not always easy integrating him into her existing family, but she said it was worth it.Since August, Davion has been spending weekends with Connie and her daughters, Sydney, 21, Carley, 17, and with her adopted son Taylor, who is now 14.Then in December, Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home. Since then there have fights and tables have been flipped, but in the end everyone loves one another, and she is prepared for the challenges.'I'm okay with messy and difficult,' she told the Tampa Bay Times. 'You just have to have your armor on all the time, but it's more than worth it. And every day things get a little bit better.' Davion became an example of the struggle faced by many teenagers in the system when in 2013 he stood up and told worshipers at his church: 'My name is Davion and I've been in foster care since I was born. I know God hasn't given up on me, so I'm not giving up either.'He then said: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be.'Davion Only, 16, has been adopted by his old case worker, Connie Bell Going in Florida (above). She has known the teen since he was seven years old. Davion had been in the foster care system his entire lifeDavion (above) captured hearts  in 2013 when he made a plea in front of a St Petersburg church congregation for a family to 'love him forever'Most of all, Davion said he just wanted a family that would 'love him forever'.Millions of people around the country soon heard about Davion's story, and the young boy was even interviewed by Barbara Walters on The View, which all eventually led to him being adopted by a minister in Ohio and his family.That is until Davion got into a fight with one of the other children, and the minister sent him back to Florida, and back to live in the foster care system.After Davion returned, people kept asking Going what it was that went wrong and caused him to be sent back after just three months.'That boy spent his whole life in the system, that's what went wrong,' she said.Making matters worse, Davion and Miss Connie, as he calls her, did not speak when he came back to Florida.Davion had cut himself off from other people, playing video games as he quickly went through four different homes and four schools in less than year.Davion Only (pictured above with Connie Going at the church where he made his speech in 2013) was adopted by a minister in Ohio but sent back into the system a few months later when he fought with one of the minister's childrenGoing says she had begun to call him numerous times, but he always hung up the phone.Then, one night last July, Davion called up Miss Connie and asked her the question he had been asking since they first met when he was only a little boy.'Do you remember what I asked you before?' he said. 'Well, how do you feel about adopting me now?'For the first time since he had asked, Going was finally able to give him the answer he wanted to hear.The 52-year-old case worker has three children of her own, one adopted and two biological daughters, and was a single mother, but she was no longer Davion's case worker, which made the process easier.From August through December he started spending more and more time with the family, a perfect fit as he was already close to Going's adopted son Taylor.Then, in December, Going got a lawyer and began the process of adopting Davion. Davion Only (pictured above in church three years ago) called and asked Miss Connie if she would adopt him last JulyDavion got his first bedroom, his first set of siblings, and, most importantly, the one thing he had been hoping for all along.'I guess I always thought of you as my mom,' Davion said to Going last December. 'Only now I get to call you that for real, right?' Davion officially became part of the family in February however, when after he and Going celebrated their birthdays, which fall on the same date, they went home and sat around the table for cake with his three siblings and signed the court papers.After 16 years Davion was finally home. What's more, because of that day in September 2013 when Davion stepped up on the pulpit, hundreds of others have been adopted as well.

{"i": "dd59f434e4a4a1f30d7b0cd7fab24e027d684f49", "src": "Whether it is through Sir Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas or Ian Stannard, Ireland's classics king Sean Kelly believes the time has come for Team Sky to break their duck in one of cycling's Monuments.With the two major cobbled classics - the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends, it is time to see the early results of Sir Dave Brailsford's move to put more emphasis on the Spring Classics in his second five-year plan for Team Sky.With Wiggins electing to sign off his Team Sky career with an appearance at Paris-Roubaix on April 12, the races are bound to be a big part of the team's season whatever the outcome.British Bradley Wiggins competes during the  the Gent-Wevelgem one day cycling race on March 29The shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season, with Stannard defending his title at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Team Sky's third victory in the Belgian race, while Thomas last week won E3 Harelbeke - a key warm-up for this weekend's Tour of Flanders.Kelly, whose record of nine Monument wins puts him in a tie for third all-time, likes what he sees from Team Sky as the big races approach.'Right now they're looking really good,' Kelly said. 'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?'Team Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics.But the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return. Luke Rowe could also be another British option for the team.Ian Stannard (3rd from front) rides in the Gent-Wevelgem one-day cycling race on March 29Injuries to classics specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory) and Tom Boonen (Etixx-QuickStep) - although the latter may return in time for Paris-Roubaix - add to the impression that Team Sky's best chance may be now.'Without Cancellara, without Boonen, it's going to be a more open race,' said Kelly, who will commentate on both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix for Eurosport.'There's going to be eight-10 guys saying they can win and Sky have three of them. Geraint is certainly in there, Stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash (in the first Monument, Milan-San Remo on March 22) but can come back, and then of course there is Wiggins.'Of the three, Wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win Paris-Roubaix, but Kelly is not counting the 2012 Tour de France winner out, saying a Monument win to add to his Tour and world time trial success would elevate Wiggins to 'another level'.'If you look at the way he's performing at the moment, for me, it's not as good as I would like him to be in the recent races, but you can't go to Paris-Roubaix with only one card to play,' Kelly said.Geraint Thomas celebrates placing third in the Belgian cycling classic Ghent-Wevelgem'With Thomas and Stannard as well, you play all of those cards and the rest look after them. If you can get to the final 10-12km and Wiggins is still there, that is where he can go on the attack.'To get to that point, Team Sky will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as 'the Hell of the North'.The brutal cobbled stretches, which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems, create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible.Although Kelly never won the Tour of Flanders, finishing second in 1984, he was victorious in Paris-Roubaix twice, 1984 and 1986, and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him.'When I first went there I had a horrendous time - I was very nervous on the cobbles and I wasn't able to ride them well,' he said. 'I slowly developed and I was able to manage to ride them, but even when I got to the point of being a Paris-Roubaix favourite it's still very nervous times.'It's a horrible race to ride, but a great race to win.'", "ref": " Team Sky have never won one of cycling's five Monument races.

{"i": "0041698b4463a633f912681b96f73648cb012e33", "src": "President Barack Obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change, refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point.After the event at Washington's Howard University on Tuesday, Obama sat down with me for a one-on-one interview. I asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average American to take away, as well as how enforceable his action plan is.Here are five things I learned:The President enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1979 (he transferred to Columbia University his junior year). While in L.A., he said, the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside. He remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside.He credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans \"a lot\" healthier, in addition to being able to \"see the mountains in the background because they aren't covered in smog.\"Obama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken.Peer-reviewed Environmental Protection Agency studies say that the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone, and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction. The EPA estimates that, between 1970 and 2010, the act and its amendments prevented 365,000 early deaths from particulate matter alone.\"No challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change,\" the President told me.When I asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health, he said, \"We know as temperatures rise, insect-borne diseases potentially start shifting up. We know, in a very straight-forward fashion, that heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses and deaths potentially increase, and so what we're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like Hurricane Sandy or big wildfires or droughts, that people recognize there's a very personal, potential impact in climate change, and the good news is we can do something about it.\"In many ways, Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us, while conceding that we don't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health.When asked what the average American can do about all this, the President encouraged ordinary citizens, doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials \"to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change.\" He also issued a presidential proclamation declaring April 6-12 as National Public Health Week \"to better understand, communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities.\"The average American can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint, including:\u2022 Change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights. One CFL can reduce up to 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime. If every house in the U.S. switched its bulbs, we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half.\u2022 Unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, this practice can save $100 a year on your energy bill.\u2022 Use a laptop instead of a desktop. Laptops are designed to be energy-efficient, because battery life is a major factor in their design. According to Energy Star, a laptop can be up to 80% more energy-efficient than a desktop.\u2022 Filter your own water. Beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste, consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store.\u2022 Adjust your curtains and thermostats. If you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter, you can save big bucks on your energy bill. The Department of Energy estimates you can save up to 15% on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you're not at home.Obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act. He  said he believes the statute is \"clear and straightforward.\" He said, \"I am not anticipating the Supreme Court would make such a bad decision.\"At issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so.The plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the Affordable Care Act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states (without state-based exchanges), possibly creating a situation, for example, in which people in Massachusetts would receive a tax credit, but people living in Texas would not.Obama did tell me that if the Supreme Court challenge is upheld, however, there is no Plan B.\"Millions of people would lose their health insurance.

At least when I was young, the team might have been rubbish and we were going nowhere, but it was exciting to be on the terraces.'There was so much more wrapped up in it, whereas now if the football is rubbish, I'm not quite sure what the lure is.'That's a long-term danger. Whether Mike Ashley is here in the future or not, there's a danger that you are turning all these people off Newcastle United and going to the match, especially with the rival attraction of being able to watch it in your local pub.'Unofficial estimates have put the actual attendance for the 3-1 defeat by Spurs at significantly lower than 47,000, although some have seemed wildly optimistic.However, there is little doubt that those who answered calls for a boycott made an impact.Jensen said: 'I thought it was a massive success. Comparing it with the walk-out at the end of last season, basically it's always going to be symbolic.'It's not going to bring Mike Ashley to his knees, but to have thousands and thousands of people, or whatever figure you want to put on it, who have already paid for something not going to the match...'Imagine thousands of people going to Tesco or Sainsbury's and buying \u00a330 worth of shopping and saying, 'Hang on a second, I'm not happy, you can have your shopping back'. It's a massive statement.'Last week's revelation that the club banked in excess of \u00a334million as well as recording a profit of \u00a318.7million for the last financial year has simply served to increase anger among fans, who have seen a squad assembled on a budget struggle to compete during the second half of the current campaign, and not for the first time in recent years.Tottenham striker Harry Kane nets his 20th league goal of the season to round off a 3-1 win over NewcastleA fan holds up a sign protesting against Ashley's ownership as Newcastle slump to a sixth straight defeatNewcastle midfielder Remy Cabella (left) jostles for possession with Tottenham's Paulinho (right) on Sunday They have not been placated by head coach John Carver's insistence that there will be investment during the summer, and an increasingly vocal lobby are demanding that Ashley sells up.Jensen said: 'When you see the benefits that he's getting, as well as now profits in each of the last four years and the way that the TV income is going, to those people who say, 'Why isn't there a buyer? There isn't one' - why wouldn't there be a buyer?'The climate of Premier League football has totally changed due to these TV deals, and so if you have got a sustainable Premier League club, especially one with the third biggest attendances, at the right price - and with a willing seller - there is definitely a buyer out there.'In the meantime, Carver faces the task of attempting to end a run of six successive league defeats, which has left the club just seven points clear of the drop zone, against the Swans.He said: 'I think there's enough experience to deal with it, yes. But we have got to stop losing players, though, sendings-off, injury...'

'Homosexuality is wrong, period. If you want to argue this fact with me then I will put your vehicle together with all bolts and no nuts and you can see how that works.'Brian Klawiter posted a message on his company's Facebook page announcing that openly gay people are not welcome at his business in Grandville, MichiganKlawiter, 35, claims he has been surprised at how his message, which he said he only expected to be read by his friends and customers, has attracted national media attention.So fat the mechanic's post has been shared over 1,000 times, attracting hundreds of comments and more than 1,800 likes.The controversy has put Klawiter and his business, Dieseltec, at the center of a media firestorm similar to the one Memories Pizza in Indiana experienced after the owner said her religious views would prevent her from serving a gay wedding.The pizza company received hate mail but also over $840,000 in donations from supporters via a GoFundMe campaign.Some critics have accused Klawiter of making his inflammatory statements to attract similar financial support, a claim he denies.The businessman claims he was taking a stand for conservative Christian values and amongst other issues, he is also promising a discount for gun owners.Critics have accused Klawiter of trying to cash in on the anti-gay backlash which netted an Indiana pizzeria over $840,000 earlier this month'I can't say I regret posting. I feel strongly about morals and belief. But the response: These people are using every tactic imaginable to absolutely destroy my business,' he told MLive.In a second Facebook post on Thursday he reiterated his intention that he would 'stand firm on my views.'He also attempted to explain that his nuts and bolts analogy was a reference to male and female reproductive organs rather than a threat to deliberately sabotage vehicles.It's unclear if Klawiter has actually refused service to someone because of their sexuality, but as the law stands he would not face any charges as Michigan has no statewide LGBT nondiscrimination protections at present.'I also am not asking for anyone to do the gofundme postings. We are a successful business and are blessed to be able to feed our families. If there is any money raised it will be redistributed to people with greater needs than ours,' he wrote on Facebook.It remains to be seen how Klawiter's business is impacted by his comments in the long run, but ThinkProgress reports that Cummins, Inc - a Fortune 500 company that manufactures engines - has notified him not to use its logo on his shop's webpage.Klawiter posted a rant on his business' Facebook page on Tuesday in which he said he was a Christian, that he would refuse to service to an openly gay person and that people with guns would get a discount", "ref": " Brian Klawiter posted a message on his company's Facebook page announcing that openly gay people are not welcome at his business.

I'm not comfortable with the idea of subsidising people who put kids' health at risk,' he said.'Childcare support should go to people who are doing the right thing by their child and the children they play with. Families who do the right thing by immunising their child shouldn't have to worry about whether their child is going to pick up a preventable illness at their childcare centre.'Social Services Minister Scott Morrison said he was open to anything in the report and admitted it made some very important suggestions in the area of immunisations", "ref": " Abbott Government are actively trying to stop parents who don't immunise their children from accessing rebates.

The pursuit of these traditions is the driving force behind the $20 billion (\u00a313bn) illegal wildlife network, the worlds third largest elicit trade, surpassed only by arms and drugs.The network activity intensifies in South East Asia home to rich biodiversity, well developed transport infrastructures, high profit margins and lax law enforcement, a haven for wildlife smugglers.

One may of thought that the rise of Guangzhou's economy and subsequent education would have reduced the consumption of endangered animals, but quite the opposite. Rising incomes have allowed more consumers to indulge in exotic foods once considered exclusive delicacies for the rich. The consumption of these endangered animals have now become a symbol of Guangzhou's new wealth.   A recent poll taken in Guangzhou found that half the population had eaten wildlife, with snake being named as the favorite of half of those surveyed. A popular saying  has it that people in Guangzhou will eat anything with fours legs accept a chair, anything that flies accept a plane and anything in water except a boat.The greatest defense of animal rights to date was during the SARS outbreak in 2003 when consumption dropped due to public fears about the risk of contracting SARS from wild animals.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, snake meat is said to be good for vision and the lower spineThe demand for civet cats decreased so much that 141 farms released 4,000 of the animals into the wild. Bird flu later added to this concerns. In recent years, consumption has recovered. In the latest line of defense stands, the South China Nature Society (SCNS), a young band of four university graduate conservationists. Established in February 2008 by Feng Minghe under the guidance of NGO - Green Eyes China, SCNS faces the mammoth task of challenging centuries of Chinese wisdom in an international hub of exotic wildlife trade.  'Our key objective is to raise awareness and educate consumers on the impact of their consumption. We hope that targeting the next generation will reduce future demand', explains Feng.Raising awareness and educating consumers takes a number of forms. The group organises various workshops and lectures in the local Guangzhou's universities.Each month, they co-ordinate field investigation among the city's live market and record the number of protected species.

Sun, a veteran snake seller at Qingping, said the market sell fewer protected species than before because many animals are near extinction and government checks are tighter. However, he did admit to selling endangered species 'under the table' including Cobra. 'The demand here is so great if I didn't sell it then someone else would, people will always buy,' he said.

In March, SCNS scored a major victory by protesting outside a Guangzhou restaurant in which was holding a nurse shark in a tiny tank in which it could barely move. Banners reading 'no consuming, no killing' in English and Chinese, caught widespread media coverage from local news channels. In the end, the shark was released to a local marine park.

But, speaking in Leeds this morning, Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over \u00a3150,000 from 45p to 40p.Tory Treasury minister David Gauke hit back with an accusation that Labour has a secret plan to boost revenues by dragging more workers into the 40p higher rate of income tax and increasing national insurance contributions.Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man' because of his plan to balance the books by spending cuts alone.Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, who cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p in his 2012 Budget, each refused to rule out a further cut to 40p in comments on Sunday. They are expected to come under further pressure on the issue during campaigning in the South West.The Labour shadow chancellor unveiled a poster claiming voters had lost \u00a31,100 each due to tax and benefit changes under the coalition with 'millions paying more while millionaires pay less' Mr Balls predicted that a Conservative government would hike VAT - something Mr Cameron has explicitly ruled out - and cut the top rate of income tax for earnings over \u00a3150,000 from 45p to 40pMr Balls said: 'We know that is their secret plan - another big tax cut for millionaires.'How can it be fair when families here in Leeds and across the country are struggling and \u00a31,100 a year worse-off?'How can it be fair to have a tax cut for the very richest when our NHS is in crisis and going backwards?'How can this be fair when we need to get the deficit down and the Tories are now planning deeper cuts in the next three years than the last five?'Mr Balls said a cut in the top rate to 40p would save someone earning \u00a31 million a year \u00a3340,000 over the course of the next Parliament, while someone with income of \u00a35 million would get a total tax cut of \u00a31.94 million over the five-year period.Meanwhile, he said that unfunded Conservative plans to cut \u00a310 million from income tax by raising thresholds for the 20p and 40p rates would require the equivalent of a two-point rise in VAT, costing an average couple with children \u00a31,440 over four years.Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg meets supporters at the Grove Pub while out campaigning in Surbiton, LondonLiberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg blasted Labour's policies as 'economically illiterate', but also warned that Chancellor George Osborne was 'a very dangerous man'Voters would not believe Mr Cameron's denial that he intends to increase the consumption tax, because Conservatives had 'a track record of breaking their promises on VAT', he said.However, Conservatives claimed secret Labour plans for tax rises would cost each working family more than \u00a33,000 over the course of the next five years - an estimate which was dismissed as unfounded by independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies a week ago.Mr Gauke said: 'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband must set out the details of their secret plan for GBP3,028 of tax rises on every working family - the British people have a right to know what these tax hikes are. The choice at this election is clear. Lower taxes under David Cameron. Or higher taxes under Ed Miliband and the SNP.'Mr Balls insisted that Labour will not raise VAT, national insurance or the basic and higher rates of income tax if it wins the general election. But he confirmed that the party would restore the 50p top rate for earnings over \u00a3150,000, as well as imposing a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco companies and closing tax loopholes.Mr Clegg hit out at both sides and warned only his party can ensure a balanced plan to clear the deficit. He said millions of people would get a tax cut worth almost \u00a3400 from a Liberal Democrat pledge to push the income tax personal allowance to \u00a312,500. By contrast, Labour's plan to reintroduce the 10p starter rate of income tax would be worth just \u00a337 to taxpayers.'Labour's short-term economic plan will lead to mounting borrowing and leave taxpayers short by hundreds of pounds, which is unfair and reckless,' said Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in Kingston-upon-Thames and the South West.'Ed Balls and Ed Miliband's tax plans are economically illiterate.Labour has already failed to commit the \u00a38 billion needed for the NHS, and are now failing to give taxpayers the tax cut they deserve.'Mr Clegg met Elise Popperwell - aged just seven months - and her mother Melissa Popperwell while out campaigning in SurbitonMr Balls said: 'All of our plans are fully costed and paid for. None of our manifesto commitments will require a single pound of extra borrowing ...'So this is the choice at the election, a choice between a Conservative Party which has a track record of breaking their promises on VAT and will raise it again after the election or a Labour Party which has never raised VAT and will not raise VAT in the next Parliament.'A Tory way which means millions pay more while millionaires pay less, or Labour's plan to back millions of working people, save our NHS and balance the books in a fair way.'Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Ukip leader Nigel Farage was concentrating on his own constituency of South Thanet, where a weekend poll suggested he was trailing in second place in the close three-way marginal.On a campaign visit to Surbiton, south-west London, Mr Clegg said that Liberal Democrats had blocked Tory plans to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p during the coalition.Conservative ministers were 'always more interested in tax cuts for people at the top rather than tax cuts for people at the bottom or the middle', Mr Clegg told Sky News.'I was very amused yesterday to hear George Osborne and David Cameron saying with earnest sincerity that they had no plan of giving further tax cuts to people at the top because, I tell you, they had exactly that plan in government and it was something that we said we would not go along with.'Mr Clegg's comments came after Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told The Independent that during coalition negotiations over tax cuts, a Conservative minister told him: 'You take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses.'", "ref": " Labour  unveils poster claiming voters lost \u00a31,100 each due to tax changes.

She also has the part-time job of being Captain of the French Fed Cup team, who are in action next weekend.Mauresmo has never made any secret of the fact that the travel is the part of the job that least appeals to her, and that will inevitably become more complicated with a baby on board. Already it must be very questionable whether she would be at the US Open which begins at the end of the August, although there has been no comment on this from either her or Murray, who has been up in Scotland ahead of tying the knot with Kim Sears in Dunblane.Murray's current coach Amelie Mauresmo has recently announced that she is expecting a baby Mauresmo, pictured at this year's Australian Open, may have to alter her coaching schedule after the birthIt is understood that the 27 year-old Scot has known about Mauresmo' s pregnancy for a number of weeks, but he was anyway planning on linking up with Bjorkman \u2013 the former world singles No 4 and doubles No 1 \u2013 prior to that.As Sportsmail reported as far back as nearly a year ago, the Swede was on Murray's shortlist to replace Ivan Lendl before he settled on the former Wimbledon women's champion as part of a groundbreaking move.A personable and intelligent man still actively involved in the game, and as someone who made the absolute best of his natural ability, he was someone the Scot identified as prime coaching material.Murray has been planning to work with former world No 3 Jonas Bjorkman as an assistant coachThe Swede, pictured winning Wimbledon with Todd Woodbridge, is a former world No 1 doubles playerLast week in Miami Murray reported that the two of them had recently spent two hours on the phone together, and he has not been able to join up before because he has been involved with Sweden's version of Strictly Come Dancing.'The time flew by,' the British No 1 said of their highly satisfactory conversation. It would be a major surprise if they somehow did not get along, or if he did not fit in with others in the team, including Mauresmo.Just where this leaves the player and his 35 year-old head coach will be for the two of them to work out. The softly-spoken Mauresmo is a very private person who prefers to keep a low profile on the tennis side of things, let alone on matters to do with her personal life.Bjorkman could have a key part to play in Murray's quest to reclaim the Wimbledon title he won in 2013She is known to have been accompanied by a girlfriend on trips with Murray to Australia and America this year, who stays in the background to the point where she has been near enough invisible.However pleased Murray will be for his coach on a personal basis \u2013 and there is no question they have become very close \u2013 he might also feel that the last thing he needs is any further complication or upheaval within his support team.His form has been good this year after all the disruptions and departures of last season, and Bjorkman appeared to be the last piece slotting into place. Now the Swede could find himself with a bigger role than was initially bargained for.", "ref": " Andy Murray is getting married to long-term girlfriend Kim Sears .

{"i": "eb30c7ef447aa8e41b9d438e5fd615e43bcc48fa", "src": "'My, my! At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender,' sang Sweden's fab four in their famous Eurovision Song Contest winner. Now this may come as a surprise, but you would be well advised not to rely on Abba to help with your history homework.If Benny and Bjorn actually laboured under this surrendering misapprehension when they wrote their song (songwriters are not hot on facts \u2013 happy to say anything as long as it rhymes), they would have discovered the truth when they subsequently paid a visit to the Wellington Museum in Waterloo, just south of Brussels in Belgium.View of Hougoumont farmhouse from The Lion's Mound or Butte du Lion on the battlefield of Waterloo, BelgiumJudging by the photo of Abba's visit, prominently on view in the museum, the group seems to have been treated to a rapturous limousine procession through the town. My, my: the people of Waterloo must have been delighted.Napoleon certainly didn't surrender at Waterloo. There was a long day's fighting on that June day in 1815 and a very shaky start for the UK team, but thanks to some late-arriving Prussian assistance, the boy Wellington eventually done good.When Napoleon saw that things were going badly, he hot-footed it to Paris, where he later abdicated.Shortly afterwards, Boney was taken by the British to the remote Atlantic isle of St Helena, where he died six years later in circumstances that merited the forensic attentions of a Miss Marple.'Waterloo' quickly entered the English language as a synonym for 'a decisive defeat'. But while the British know what happened when Napoleon met his Waterloo, the French-speaking world is less convinced.Battle of Waterloo reenactors stand in historic costume, with rifles and flagsBelgium is divided into two halves: Flemish-speaking and French-speaking. It is unfortunate for anniversary-celebrating purposes that Waterloo lies in the French half where the locals are preparing to mark the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo \u2013 with Napoleon as the unchallenged star of the show.Local Anglo-Belgian entrepreneur Anthony Martin has invested a substantial financial stake in plans for marking the anniversary by turning a Templar hospice on the edge of the battlefield into a magnificent restaurant-cum-brewery (where he brews Waterloo beer, of course) and a museum looking at the surgical side of the battle (not for the squeamish).It would be fair to say that Mr Martin is not best pleased by the outbreak of Napoleon-worship. He points to the poster advertising the re-enactment event which will be taking place this summer over four days from June 18 to 21; the photograph shows a giant, heroic Napoleon towering over the smaller, less impressive figures of Wellington and Prussian leader Blucher.'It's ridiculous,' says Mr Martin. 'The French-speaking world refuses to believe Napoleon lost the battle. A painting of the Battle of Waterloo; 2015 marks the 200th anniversary of the battleAs far as they're concerned, he scored some sort of moral victory. He lost. But they won't accept it.'However, the French-speaking world \u2013 and especially the French \u2013 don't figure very significantly in the numbers of tourists who visit the famous battlefield site every year. The British \u2013 and the English-speaking nations of the world \u2013 remain fascinated by the victory and the bloody manner in which it was achieved.Actually, horror-seeking tourists visited the battlefield almost before they had finished burying the bodies. Poet Lord Byron, something of a Bonaparte fan, suddenly found he had time to visit the battlefield when his lavish coach, modelled on Napoleon's battle carriage, broke down on his journey from the Channel to the south.'My, my! At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender!' Abba pictured in the town of Waterloo, Belgium in 1974In a Top Gear moment, Byron treated himself to a charge across the battleground on a large Cossack horse he had hired, making himself perhaps the first battlefield tourist. Hard on his heels came Poet Laureate Robert Southey; Sir Walter Scott; the artist Turner; and, a few years later, William Wordsworth. It's worth recalling that Wordsworth, as a young man, had welcomed the French Revolution ('Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive\u2026') but rapidly shifted his political stance to somewhere far to the right of Attila the Hun.Soon Waterloo was established as one of the great continental sights. It was British tourists visiting Waterloo who discovered the neglected city of Bruges \u2013 largely derelict after its access to the sea silted up \u2013 and helped to finance its restoration.There was an unmistakable sense that Waterloo had been a defining moment in history: Europe had been reshaped and, the odd Franco-German conflict apart, peace reigned for a century.The pleasure of the area around Waterloo is that in many ways it has barely changed.A statue sits atop the Lion's Mound, which commemorates the battlefield at Waterloo, BelgiumIf you have time, follow the progress of the conflict along La Route Napoleon \u2013 what else? \u2013 from Beaumont, where he camped near the French border on June 14, to the fields south of Waterloo where he was defeated four days later.Despite facing superior forces with a hastily assembled army, it is extraordinary that Napoleon came very close to victory.Wellington reflected: 'It has been a damned serious business. Blucher and I have lost 30,000 men \u2013 the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life...'Unbelievable for me was encountering the present Duke of Wellington in the flesh at Waterloo. He was attending the opening ceremony for a new exhibition at the Wellington Museum on the 'Shared Destinies' of Wellington and Napoleon, who fought each other often but never met. It runs until the end of July.My favourite exhibit is Lord Uxbridge's wooden leg. At the end of the battle, Uxbridge was riding near Wellington when they came under cannon fire.'By God, sir, I've lost my leg!' announced Uxbridge, to which Wellington replied: 'By God, sir, so you have!' Uxbridge was taken to the town of Waterloo, where his right leg was amputated above the knee.His only recorded comment during the operation was: 'The knives appear somewhat blunt.' Presumably he had taken advantage of the pint of gin offered as anaesthetic to anyone facing an amputation.The severed leg was buried behind the house and its grave became a tourist attraction. Sadly it is no more, but you can see his wooden limb in the museum.Perhaps the most interesting sight on the battlefield is Hougoumont farm, whose heroic defence by the British is recognised as the pivotal moment of the battle.Efforts to restore the property and turn it into a museum were for a long time frustrated by lack of funds, but the project was rescued last year following the intervention of Chancellor George Osborne who, it turned out, was something of a battlefield enthusiast. An injection of \u00a31 million has ensured Hougoumont will open to the public for the first time for the celebrations in June, with guests able to stay in a self-catering cottage within the farm \u2013 and as far as I could tell from my visit last month, Hougoumont is a Napoleon-free zone.May marks the 75th anniversary of Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied troops from DunkirkDunkirkWhile June marks the anniversary of a glorious victory, May sees the 75th anniversary of what has sometimes been referred to as a glorious failure: Operation Dynamo \u2013 the evacuation of Allied troops from the beaches near Dunkirk from May 26 to June 4, 1940.The extraordinary rescue, the largest evacuation in military history, saw 338,226 soldiers brought home to England in the face of ferocious bombing from German aircraft. Walk along the wide beach at Zuydcoote, a 15-minute drive from the centre of Dunkirk, and at first glance there is little to hint at the awful scenes of death and destruction here 75 years ago.I was there with Bruno Pruvost, a diver who has explored the wrecks on and near the beach \u2013 some of the 336 'little ships' that set sail from England, answering the emergency call, but which never returned.At low tide you can visit the wreck of the Crested Eagle, a Thames river cruiser that picked up 600 men from the beach but was then bombed by a Stuka. With his ship in flames, the captain beached the ship with the hope of saving as many of his passengers as possible,You can find out more about the Crested Eagle and the other ships at the excellent Memorial du Souvenir at Dunkirk. Also well worth visiting is the Fort des Dunes, built as part of a grand defensive line against possible German invasion in the 19th Century \u2013 and which played its part in the evacuation.Back on the beach at Zuydcoote, Bruno picked up a small black pellet from the beach: 'Coal from the bunkers of sunken ships \u2013 this gets washed up all the time.' The sea is still giving up its war souvenirs.Eurostar (eurostar.com, 08432 186186) offers nine daily services from London St Pancras International to Brussels from \u00a372.
