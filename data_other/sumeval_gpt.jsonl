{"src": "( CNN ) Donald Sterling 's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year . But now it 's his former female companion who has lost big . A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $ 2.6 million in gifts after Sterling 's wife sued her . In the lawsuit , Rochelle `` Shelly '' Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men . She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple 's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari , two Bentleys and a Range Rover , and that he helped her get a $ 1.8 million duplex . Who is V. Stiviano ? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner , who made much of his fortune in real estate . Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday , her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC . `` This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $ 2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress , '' attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement . `` It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts . '' Stiviano 's gifts from Donald Sterling did n't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars . According to the Los Angeles Times , the list also includes a $ 391 Easter bunny costume , a $ 299 two-speed blender and a $ 12 lace thong . Donald Sterling 's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano . In the tape , Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans , including basketball legend Magic Johnson . `` In your lousy f**ing Instagrams , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , '' Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ . He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling 's friends can see . `` Admire him , bring him here , feed him , f**k him , but do n't put ( Magic ) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me , '' Sterling said . NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league , fined him $ 2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise .

{"src": "( CNN ) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

{"src": "( CNN ) A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday . The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan 's eye . He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport . The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia . `` The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from , '' Durken said . The fires were started in southeastern Siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields . But on April 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV . As a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region . Rescue crews were able to put out the flames . However , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds . The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest . Parts of Oregon , Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination . The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , KOMO-TV said . That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered . The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye . As the smoke starts to dissipate , air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue .", "i": "cnn-test-a02e362c5b8f049848ce718b37b96117485461cf", "tgt": {"M11": "Deep reddish color caught seattle native tim durkan 's eye on april 14 .

'' What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon ? The smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth 's atmosphere . The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and ISSpresso , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea . The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon . They 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to Earth . When they 're done , Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California .

Rescues came next . And then , starting in August , the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria .

{"src": "( CNN ) The classic video game `` Space Invaders '' was developed in Japan back in the late 1970 's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan 's corridors of power . Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly ' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites , according to police . Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window , tying a rope around the rifle case 's handle or a cable lock , and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case 's handle free from the lock . The window frame of the agent 's car was pulled from the door , which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window . 'The rifle had been secured properly , ' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City . 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure . Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon . ' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag , backpack , and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft , which the police report states happened overnight . The theft happened just a week before Obama ( pictured during his visit ) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car , as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case . The agent 's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street , but the sniper rifle has not been recovered . Marriott Springhill Suites , the agent 's hotel , is next to the city 's airport and just down the street from the state 's FBI office . The hotel does not have surveillance cameras , according to the police report . Salt Lake City police said the rifle 's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer . The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama 's visit , but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security .

Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half . 'It 's important to win a match and gain some continuity , ' De Sanctis said . 'The last ( four ) months were tough in terms of results . So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride . ' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack Pjanic ( second left ) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe , and Daniele de Rossi after scoring Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio , who play later on Saturday . They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30 . Meanwhile , Napoli 's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches , and Diego Maradona 's former club remained fifth . Security was tight for Napoli 's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season 's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico . Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis ( right ) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order . But there were no reports of problems . Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post . A few minutes later , Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi , who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in . Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma , who have fallen off the pace recently Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there was n't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli , who officiated last year 's World Cup final . In the second half , De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions . The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th . Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net . Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November .", "i": "dm-test-18243373494a1722ddcd162ec67b63dd749633ab", "tgt": {"M11": "Roma beat napoli beat napoli in serie a on saturday .

Accompanied with the caption : 'Excited about my new cool gadget ! It 's just like Michael Knight 's watch , but a real one # knightrider # phone , ' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday . The midfielder , who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season , is expected to start for Arsene Wenger 's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday .

And club legend Ray Parlour believes that the 23-year-old \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc I think he \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s the future of the club , \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 said Parlour . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc I think if he stays fit , he \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s a quality player , there \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s no doubt about that .

Look at Abou Diaby . Diaby \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s a terrific player . But look at him , the injuries the last few years . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period , like he hasn \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 t had for the last three or four seasons. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Wilshere , the England international , is pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week", "i": "dm-test-2cfc33d01364162579f46b2764914a03a29453ce", "tgt": {"M11": "Arsenal midfielder mesut ozil has scored four goals in the premier league .

The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish , clearly saddened by this , following it up to the surface of the water . According to Mr Giroux , who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel , the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish . The fish swims away from the man 's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet . He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable . After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 t play with it on a daily basis .

They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January , but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress . Reds have captain Steven Gerrard ( centre ) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc When you get so close , whether it was in the title race or the cup , it hurts , \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 said Rodgers . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc Trace back the winners in sport . If you look at everything they have won , also look at what they have lost . You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals . It \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s all part of the journey \u00e2\u20ac\u201d losing but taking that forward and improving you. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Rodgers ( left ) has n't revealed whether he 'll recall Gerrard for Sunday 's clash against Aston Villa at Wembley", "i": "dm-test-3ba3bde4a1440134bb38ec22ba50db59986b544c", "tgt": {"M11": "Brendan rodgers says raheem sterling and jordon ibe .

' I like the idea of challenging myself and want to motivate people to do the same - so why not get your bike out of the shed and see how far you can go in an hour ? ' Wiggins , whose track pedigree includes three Olympic gold medals , is expected to set a mark which will last for some time . Wiggins will hope for a capacity 6,000 crowd to spur on his attempt , with tickets going on sale from April 19 , while the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports . In June , Wiggins will hope to race in front of a sell-out crowd at London 's Olympic Velodrome Wiggins ( left ) alongside his Team Sky colleague Luke Rowe after the pair raced the Paris-Roubaix Wiggins will look to beat the record of Dennis ( pictured ) , who managed to cycle 52.491km in an hour The Briton finished his Team Sky career at Paris-Roubaix last Sunday and will ride in next month 's inaugural Tour de Yorkshire for his eponymous team before preparing for the Hour as part of his return to the track . The world time-trial champion is targeting a British record eighth Olympic medal - he has four gold , one silver and two bronze - at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the four-man , four-kilometre team pursuit . The current Hour record is 52.491km , set by Australian Rohan Dennis in February after the UCI , cycling 's world governing body , reformed regulations , reigniting interest in the event . German Jens Voigt was the first to make an attempt last September , recording 51.115km , a mark which stood for six weeks before Austria 's Matthias Brandle rode 51.852km , while Jack Bobridge was the first to fall short in his attempt . Dennis ' mark will come under threat from Briton Alex Dowsett , who will make his attempt on May 2 in Manchester having had to postpone it previously after suffering a broken collarbone .

And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week , which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk ' . The system , suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo , would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles ( 100km ) away . Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s atmosphere , where it would burn up .

Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury , pictured , to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil 's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off . After the suspected breach of exam rules , school officials were tipped off , resulting in an investigation being launched in June . The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same . It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told . Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct . The Department for Education annulled the whole school 's SAT 's results after a probe by the local education authority ( file picture ) However , he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers , but to make them more legible . But the panel , run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions . Panel chair Martin Pilkington said , although the teacher \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s conduct had been dishonest , it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty . But he added : 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school , that can in no way excuse his behaviour . 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority . ' Paul Heathcote , acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan , banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years . He said : 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014 . 'Mr Guffick \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress . 'In all the circumstances , I agree with the panel \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction .

{"src": "Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal , following an outcry on his behalf . The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc reckless \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion , as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27 . Hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . Although it was accepted that there had been no intent , the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing . Yet , in a stunning twist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in light of fierce criticism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held . Nathan Hughes 's knee collided with George North 's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin 's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side 's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months . He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing , to counter-act his concussion symptoms . Graphic , slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes , but many more spoke up in his defence . Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and their dismay was shared by others outside the club . Captain James Haskell said : \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc Astounded would be an under-statement \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 , while fly-half Andy Goode added : \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc Really can \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes . There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc total joke \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment , calling it an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc absolute joke \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 . Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday , as he awaited his appeal hearing . He is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26 . Jeremy Summers , chairman of the appeal hearing panel , said : \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh . Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel , it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally . \u00e2\u20ac\u2122", "i": "dm-test-81bd721b16cad47dfd8d24baca5b30b006291db2", "tgt": {"M11": "Nathan hughes suffered his knee colliding with the head of the welsh lion .

The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places , exposing what used to be the ocean floor . Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby , when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop , pivoting the underwater area into the air .

A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu , on Hokkaido Island , Japan 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide ' , local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday . The mass , which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level , measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long , and 100ft wide , a town official said . The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals , as there was no indication of the land movement overnight 'The local residents said they did n't hear any sounds and there were no tremors ( when the land appeared ) , ' said Katsuhiro Tanaka , the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association , who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered . The mass , which has risen some 50ft above sea level , measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long , and 100ft wide No clue : Local residents on Hokkaido island say they felt no tremors overnight , or heard any sounds to indicate movement , and that the landmass just appeared New view : Local residents from Rausu , Hokkaido , take a look at the newly emerged coastline Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline , but they do not expect it to expand further , said an official at the central government 's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau . 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes , ' he told AFP .

Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team Stokes ( left ) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England But Stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs . I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who can not capture the imagination . He has something about him , as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s face during the Ashes series . He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return . But I do believe he will need careful man-managing . Peter Moores , England \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right . The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on . England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on . It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad . What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed . He can be feisty and fiery as long as it \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s natural but his aggression has to be controlled . You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets . Stokes ( second left ) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team Stokes ( left ) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally . There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible . This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game . They can only get better and that \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s an exciting prospect .", "i": "dm-test-8b51a10370a1219137e231192e65b9cd52238ea6", "tgt": {"M11": "Ben stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in england cricket team .

{"src": "Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , was arrested on Monday amid claims she had sex with pupil , 15 , in her car on consecutive nights in January A Texas math teacher has been accused of having sex with an underage pupil from a Texas high school a month after she was arrested for letting another teenage touch her breasts . Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her .

Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish , Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge . 'He has done very well . I think he found a solution at the right time , ' the Arsenal manager said .

Federal MP Bob Katter , who released a statement today accusing the Queensland Government of assuming Billy Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk . He announced on Wednesday he will remain in the Queensland parliament as an independent , throwing the Government , which holds a razor-thin majority , into chaos . 'In the last two cases where this occurred in the federal parliament , there was never any question raised about the member resigning . So why was it assumed here that Billy Gordon would resign ? ' Mr Katter 's statement reads . ' I ca n't help but think that the Queensland Government thought they had a little black puppet on a string . Mr Gordon , who was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of being accused of domestic violence and withholding his criminal history The statement has sparked criticism on social media , with users questioning his terminology .

' The statement has sparked criticism on social media , with some users questioning his terminology Mr Katter has since defended the statement , saying he used the term black puppet in light of his personal experiences Mr Katter has since defended the statement , saying he used the term black puppet 'because I 'm dark and I come from Cloncurry . ' ' I can understand and I can identify with the attitudes that these people have and I 'm going to call it for what it is , ' he said . ' I deliberately put that comment in with a forethought , because I think they deserve a belting for the racial overtones . ' Mr Katter used federal MPs Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott as examples of independents becoming puppets for the government and sacrificing their independence , but he vowed Mr Gordon would not make that mistake .", "i": "dm-test-9b5a04b9879fe716a2dcd66dd331f99534603c16", "tgt": {"M11": "Bob katter said the government believes mr gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence .

{"src": "Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk . James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents , Phil , 44 , and Hazel , 38 , with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote . But security officers , who were described as 'over-zealous ' by the boy 's father , then took exception to James 's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system 's X-ray machines . They demanded he hand it over , and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child . Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous ' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation . Mr Hayward , a software engineer , said : 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old . 'We were so late by this point I did n't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we did n't want to miss our flight . ' I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday . We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter . ' I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time . 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid . Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote , the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward 's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00c2\u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers , and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays . East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family 's home in Doncaster , South Yorkshire . Defending the decision a spokeswoman said : 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government .

'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason .

They need a goalkeeper , they still need a centre back , they still need a holding midfielder and , I 'm afraid , they need a top , top quality striker to win this league again . 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today . They were struggling last season to win the league . They went on to buy [ Thibaut ] Cortouis , [ Nemanja ] Matic , Cesc [ Fabregas ] and [ Diego ] Costa . 'For me , that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team did n't and a team did , and they are about to win the league again . Arsenal are third in the Premier League , level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [ Arsene Wenger ] has to do it . You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league , that has to happen . ' And he added on Giroud 's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season : ' I think Giroud is doing extremely well . But can you win the league with him ? I would n't think so . 'He does a job , and he does it ever so well , but you ca n't win the league .

{"src": "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby ' . Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine .

Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser . Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote . The result leaves United , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand . Injury-ravaged City however , have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series .

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls . ' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties . He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions . Keely Harvey , in mitigation , said : 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child 's hand . ' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant ' and he was made the subject of a hospital order . Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said : 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be . 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties , so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency .

{"src": "Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy , it was revealed yesterday . Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 he told the Sunday People . \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc I was staggered . The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me , holding me in the chair . Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc haunted \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc exhaustively and co-operatively \u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with any police probe .
